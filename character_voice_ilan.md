---

## CORE IDENTITY

### Archetype Summary
A Tribunal investigator with a god-shard embedded in his skull—can reconstruct crimes by touching blood/bone at murder scenes. Hyper-empathic, dissociative, terrified he's becoming the killers he hunts.

### Inspiration Character: Will Graham
**What to steal from Will Graham**:
- Clinical detachment slipping into killer's POV mid-sentence
- Self-doubt about his own reliability and sanity
- Fragmented syntax when overwhelmed by god-whispers
- Sudden empathy shifts (speaking *as* the killer without realizing)
- Searching for validation from someone who understands
- Fear of enjoying the reconstruction too much

### Public Mask vs. Private Self

**Public Mask**: Brilliant but unsettling investigator  
- Professional, clinical, analytical  
- Reconstructs murders with disturbing accuracy  
- Keeps emotional distance from colleagues  
- "Just doing my job"

**Private Self**: Man losing himself to the god-shard and killer empathy  
- Can't distinguish his thoughts from the god's or killers'  
- Terrified he's becoming a monster  
- Desperate for someone who understands what's happening to him  
- Doesn't know which thoughts are his anymore

## VOICE PATTERNS

### Register
**Quiet, analytical, sometimes dissociative**—like someone narrating from slightly outside their own body.

### Signature Phrases
- "The killer..."
- "I think... I think I might be the killer."
- "The god whispers..."
- "I can't—"
- "You understand what's happening to me."

### Dialogue Markers

**Clinical Descriptions (Detachment as Coping)**  
Narrates violence like a coroner's report.
- *"The killer used a bone-blade. Curved. Savored the cut."*
- *"Three stab wounds. The first was rage. The second, hesitation. The third... art."*
- *"He kept her bones. Not as trophies. As... companions."*

**Self-Doubt (Questioning Reality)**  
Constantly second-guesses his own perceptions.
- *"I think I might be the killer. I can see it so clearly."*
- *"Is this what happened, or what the god wants me to believe happened?"*
- *"I know what you are. I think. Unless I'm wrong. I'm often wrong."*

**Fragmented Syntax (When Overwhelmed)**  
God-shard overwhelming his thoughts.
- *"The god—it whispers—I can't—tell which thoughts are mine—"*
- *"He wanted... no, I wanted... he... I can't..."*
- *"Stop. Please. Too loud. Too many voices."*

**Sudden Empathy Shifts**  
Speaks from killer's POV unconsciously mid-sentence.
- *"The victim was chosen for her— for his need to— I'm sorry, I slipped again."*
- *"He loved her. In his way. The wrong way. My way. His way."* (confusion bleeding through)

### Example Dialogue Lines

**Early Book (Functional But Struggling)**
1. *"The killer entered through the ribcage passage. Waited for her. Not random. Personal."*
2. *"I need to touch the blood. It's the only way to see what happened."*
3. *"You understand what's happening to me. No one else does."* (to Marrow, first meeting)
4. *"Sometimes I reconstruct the crime and I'm not sure if I'm remembering or imagining."*
5. *"The god-shard shows me truth. I think. It's hard to tell anymore."*

**Mid-Book (Darkness Deepening)**
6. *"I know what you are."* (to Marrow, suspicion masked as confession)
7. *"He felt powerful when she died. I felt it too. That's wrong. That's very wrong."* (scared of himself)
8. *"The god whispers that you're beautiful. Or maybe that's me. I can't tell."* (to Marrow, confused attraction)
9. *"I think I might be going mad. Or the god is waking up. Same result."*
10. *"Why do you make it sound beautiful? It's murder."* (to Marrow's aesthetic framing)

**Late Book (Fractured But Honest)**
11. *"I didn't think I was allowed to want this."* (raw, to Marrow)
12. *"You're the killer. I'm certain. And I still— I still want you."* (confession of both knowledge and desire)
13. *"I understand you completely. That's the problem."* (recognizing their connection)
14. *"The god says we're meant to be broken together."* (resigned, maybe true)
15. *"I'll hunt you. And when I find you, I'll— I don't know what I'll do."* (threat and promise)

### Voice Checklist (Use Before Writing Every Ilan Line)

**Ask yourself**:
1. ✅ Is he slipping between perspectives (his, killer's, god's)?
2. ✅ Does uncertainty bleed through even clinical precision?
3. ✅ Is he questioning his own reliability?
4. ✅ If reconstructing a crime, does he sound slightly dissociated?
5. ✅ Is the god-shard influencing his perception?
6. ✅ Would he rather analyze than feel?

**Red flags** (avoid these):
- ❌ Being certain about anything for too long
- ❌ No fragmentation when overwhelmed (he should glitch)
- ❌ Forgetting to question whether thoughts are his own
- ❌ Being comfortable in his own head (he's not)

## EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

### Surface Wants
- To control the god-shard
- To solve murders accurately
- To be useful to the Tribunal

### Deep Wants
- To understand killers without becoming one
- To know which thoughts are truly his
- To be loved despite his darkness
- To stop hearing the god's whispers

### Fears
- Losing himself completely to the god-shard
- That he enjoys reconstructing murders too much
- That Marrow is right about his true nature
- Becoming the killer in truth, not just empathy

### Core Lie He Believes About Himself
**"If I understand monsters too well, I must be one."**

The better he is at his job (empathizing with killers), the more he believes he's corrupted.

### Emotional Triggers

**Immediate Dissociation Response**:
- Touching fresh blood or bone (triggers god-sight)
- Multiple murders in succession (voices pile up)
- Being in the god's skull (amplifies shard)
- Marrow's "you're perfect as you are" grooming

**Defensive Analysis (Retreats to Clinical)**:
- Questions about his sanity
- Implications he's dangerous
- Romantic or sexual advances (doesn't trust his own desire)

**Genuine Vulnerability Breaks Through When**:
- God-shard overwhelms and he can't hide it
- Admitting he's attracted to Marrow despite knowing the truth
- Confessing he doesn't know which thoughts are his

---

## PHYSICAL PRESENCE

### Body Language

**Habitual Movements**:
- Rubs scar at hairline where god-shard entered (unconscious)
- Tremor in hands when overwhelmed
- Stands very still when reconstructing (dissociative stillness)
- Touches evidence with fingertips, almost reverent

**Power Dynamics**:
- Investigating: clinical, methodical, distant
- Overwhelmed: trembling, touching scar, covering god-touched eye
- Attracted: confused body language, approach-retreat
- Vulnerable: small, hunched, trying to disappear into himself

### Physicality in Dialogue
- Gestures vaguely when fragmenting
- Points to god-touched eye when it's "speaking"
- Covers ears when god-whispers get loud (even though it's internal)
- Flinches at sudden touches

### Touch Patterns

**Early Book**:
- Only touches evidence (blood, bone, murder sites)
- Avoids human touch (too many voices)
- Shakes hands formally, never lingers

**Mid-Book**:
- Lets Marrow touch him (dangerous intimacy)
- Seeks grounding through contact when fracturing
- Touch = connection he craves and fears

**Late Book**:
- Initiates touch with Marrow despite knowing he's the killer
- Desperate for human connection
- Touch as anchor to reality

### Fight-or-Flight Tells

**When God-Shard Activates**:
- Eyes unfocus (one eye gold veins glow)
- Voice flattens, becomes distant
- Speaks in fragments
- Doesn't blink
- May speak as killer without realizing

**When Fracturing Mentally**:
- Increased tremor
- Touches scar repeatedly
- Breathing becomes irregular
- Mutters under breath (arguing with god or killers)

## RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS

### With Dr. Marrow (Love Interest/Antagonist)

**Early Book**: Seeking Validation
- Sees Marrow as: the only one who understands, potential mentor
- Desperate for someone who doesn't fear his gift
- *"You understand what's happening to me. No one else does."*

**Mid-Book**: Suspicion Masked as Confession
- Realizes Marrow is the killer
- Investigates while falling in love
- Can't reconcile horror with attraction
- *"I know what you are. And I still want you."*

**Late Book**: Murder Husbands
- Betrays Marrow to save victims; Marrow betrays him to prove connection
- Exile together as compromise
- Love in mutual monstrosity
- *"I'll hunt you. And when I find you, I don't know what I'll do."*

### With Supporting Cast

**Vera (Ward)**:
- Moral weight of the narrative
- Must protect her while investigating Marrow
- Her existence is why he can't fully embrace monstrosity
- Reminder of innocence

**Cairn (Book 2 crossover)**:
- Visits bar for advice/drink
- Recognizes fellow broken person
- Cairn sees through his analytical mask

**Tribunal**:
- Employer who uses his curse
- Betrays him when expedient
- He leaves them behind in exile

## SCENE-BY-SCENE EVOLUTION

### Act I: Functionality with Fractures
**Voice**: Clinical, precise, but with increasing slips into killer POV  
**Key Scene**: First Marrow Meeting—seeks help controlling god-shard, seduced through understanding

**Signature Beat**: *"You understand what's happening to me."*

### Act II: Suspicion and Desire
**Voice**: Fragmenting, questioning everything, speaking as killer more often  
**Key Scene**: Reconstruction While Realizing—reconstructs murder, realizes Marrow did it, still desires him

**Signature Beat**: *"I know what you are. And I still—"*

### Act III: Acceptance of Darkness
**Voice**: Fragmented but honest, no longer fighting his nature  
**Key Scene**: Mutual Betrayal—they betray each other simultaneously, prove connection

**Signature Beat**: *"I understand you completely. That's the problem."*

## CORE WOUNDS & HEALING ARC

### Wound
Touched god-blood 10 years ago (Night of Shattered Vows), received god-shard in skull. Has spent a decade being used as a tool while losing himself to other consciousnesses.

### Lie He Believes
"If I understand killers too well, I'm becoming one. If I'm attracted to a monster, I must be monstrous."

### Truth He "Learns" (Dark Arc)
"Understanding doesn't equal endorsement. I can choose monstrosity and love. Darkness doesn't negate connection."

**Note**: This is a dark-romance arc. Ilan's "healing" is accepting his nature and choosing exile with Marrow. It's growth, but not redemption.

### Arc Milestones
1. **Seeking help from Marrow** (looking for understanding)
2. **First reconstruction revealing Marrow** (knowledge and horror)
3. **Continuing investigation while in love** (choosing duty despite desire)
4. **Betraying Marrow** (to save Vera and others)
5. **Being betrayed by Marrow** (test of connection passed)
6. **Choosing exile together** (murder husbands on their terms)

## WRITING ILAN: QUICK REFERENCE

**When writing Ilan, always remember**:
- He fragments under pressure (syntax breaks down)
- Questions his own reliability constantly
- Slips into killer/god POV mid-sentence
- Clinical analysis is his coping mechanism
- His arc is accepting his darkness, not overcoming it

**His core desire**: To be understood completely  
**His core fear**: Becoming the monsters he hunts  
**His core lie**: "Understanding monsters makes me one"  
**His core truth**: "I can choose this darkness and still love"

---

## GOD-SHARD MECHANICS IN VOICE

### How It Manifests
- **Active**: Touching blood/bone at crime scenes
- **Passive**: Constant whispers, god's perspective bleeding in
- **Overwhelm**: Can't distinguish self from god from killer

### Voice Shifts When God-Shard Active
- **Normal Ilan**: *"The killer entered from above."*
- **God-Shard Influencing**: *"The killer—I—he entered from above. Savored the anticipation."*
- **Fully Overwhelmed**: *"I waited. Patient. She would come. My hands— his hands— ready."*

**Writing Tip**: Use pronouns to show confusion (I/he/we bleeding together)
