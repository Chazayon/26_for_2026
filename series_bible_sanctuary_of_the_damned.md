## Magic System

### Soul Contracts
- **Definition**: Legally binding magical agreements that reshape reality and personhood
- **Mechanics**: Signed in blood or marrow; enforced by the Prime Contract's power
- **Consequences**: Violating a contract erodes the signer's legal existence, memories, free will
- **Loopholes**: "Founder clauses" predating normal law; consent violations; death of contracting party

### Redemption Marks (Merit Marks)
- **Definition**: Sigils earned by monsters serving the Vigil, tracking "redemption progress"
- **Mechanics**: Carved into skin/bone; glow when recognized by officials
- **Purpose**: Supposedly earn freedom; actually feed the Prime Contract
- **Book 1**: Cyran seeks enough marks for legal personhood; discovers the system is corrupt

### Grace
- **Definition**: Narcotic spinal-fluid drug refined from god-marrow
- **Effects**: Euphoria, pain suppression, dissociation, enhanced performance
- **Side Effects**: Addiction, memory loss, emotional numbing, physical dependency
- **Production**: Blessed by Contract Lords using Prime Contract power
- **Book 2**: Seraph's addiction and recovery arc; revealed as control mechanism

### God-Shard Empathy
- **Definition**: Fragment of the dead god's consciousness embedded in a mortal mind
- **Mechanics**: Touch blood/bone at crime scenes to reconstruct events through killer's POV
- **Cost**: Psychological fracturing, god-whispers, loss of self/other boundaries
- **Ilan's Curse**: Can't distinguish his thoughts from the god's or killers'
- **Book 3**: The gift that makes Ilan valuable and vulnerable

### Dreamscape Magic
- **Definition**: Reality within the god's skull/pupil where thought becomes form
- **Mechanics**: Eldritch entities (like Cipher) exist here; can be entered via ritual
- **Rules**: Consent and knowledge are power; deals made here bind across realities
- **Book 4**: Where Solen and Cipher confront the Prime Contract

## The Prime Contract / The Nameless Creditor

### Nature
- Memory-eating, contract-feeding entity that crawled into the god's corpse at death
- Not a person—a predatory intelligence made of names, debts, and signatures
- Manifests as a many-mouthed tangle of clauses in the dreamscape

### The First Contract
- Made with the original Contract Lords centuries ago
- Terms: "We feed you names, memories, and love bound in contracts; you stabilize the city and grant us power over souls"
- Every soul contract, Redemption Mark, Intimacy Clause feeds it

### Physical Manifestations
- **Heart-Node** (Book 1): Temple rituals channel power here
- **Economic Tithes** (Book 2): Pleasure/shame harvested through contracts
- **Judicial Corruption** (Book 3): Justice system infected; "legal" killings feed it
- **God-Remnant Avatars** (Book 3): Physical extensions trying to grow beyond the city
- **Core Entity** (Book 4): The intelligence itself in the skull-dreamscape

### Destruction
- Books 1-3 damage individual nodes/manifestations
- Book 4: Solen rewrites the First Contract, severing its right to feed on love/free will
- Result: Dies as independent predator; becomes static law that can be renegotiated
