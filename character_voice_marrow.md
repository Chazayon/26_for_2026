### Voice Checklist (Use Before Writing Every Marrow Line)

**Ask yourself**:
1. ✅ Does he make violence sound like art?
2. ✅ Is there elegance in the horror?
3. ✅ Does he frame darkness as enlightenment?
4. ✅ Is he cultivating Ilan intentionally?
5. ✅ If threatened, does warmth vanish completely?
6. ✅ Could this line be in a philosophy text or therapy session?

**Red flags** (avoid these):
- ❌ Crude or direct violence (he's aesthetic always)
- ❌ Losing composure (except calculated coldness)
- ❌ Explaining himself except to Ilan (mystery to others)
- ❌ Being obviously evil to everyone (only Ilan sees the truth)

## CORE WOUNDS & HEALING ARC

### Wound
Ancient undead who's experienced centuries. Nothing new, nothing beautiful enough. Profoundly, existentially bored until Ilan.

### Design in the System
He's a tool designed by the Prime Contract to cull certain populations. His murders serve the system. This is his rebellion—killing for *art*, not duty.

### Arc (Dark Growth)
Learning to compromise, to want someone's autonomous choice rather than possession. Still a killer, still monstrous, but capable of consensual love.

### Arc Milestones
1. **Meeting Ilan** (first interesting person in decades)
2. **Creating art for an audience** (murders meant for Ilan)
3. **Revealing himself** (ultimate intimacy)
4. **Being betrayed** (first time it matters)
5. **Choosing compromise** (exile with Ilan over perfect freedom)  
6. **Love with boundaries** (growth for him)
