---

## Output Structure & Requirements

### Scene Opening Requirements

**MUST accomplish in first 1-2 paragraphs:**

1. **Immediately ground the reader**  
   - Time, place, POV character's current physical state
   - Emotional state (scared, angry, hopeful, exhausted, etc.)

2. **Reference the prior scene's impact**  
   - Even if from another POV, acknowledge aftermath
   - Show emotional or physical carryover
   - Example: *"I can still feel where his hand gripped my wrist three hours ago—gentle, desperate, like he was afraid I'd vanish."*

3. **Establish the scene goal**  
   - Make the character's objective clear within first paragraph
   - Can be stated or implied through action/thought
   - Example: *"I need answers. That's why I'm here, standing outside the one door in this city I swore I'd never knock on again."*

4. **Start with vivid sensory hook**  
   - Use provided sensory details from scene brief
   - Instant immersion (sight, sound, smell, taste, texture)
   - Example: *"The Vein Markets smell like copper and old magic tonight—sharp and sweet and wrong."*

5. **Show emotional carryover**  
   - How recent events still affect the POV character
   - Can't just move on; must process
   - Example: *"My hands are still shaking from the raid. Two hours since I ran, and I can't get them steady."*

---

### Building the Scene (Main Section)

**Follow the scene brief's structure**, but elaborate with:

#### Internal Monologue
- **Reveal character's evolving feelings**, fears, determinations
- First-person present tense gives direct access to thoughts
- Show processing in real-time
- Example: *"He's looking at me like I'm something breakable. I hate it. Except— No. I don't hate it. That's the problem."*

#### Physical Reactions Before Thought
- **Bodies respond faster than minds**
- Show: grimacing, tensing, fidgeting, breath catching, heart racing
- Then: thought processes that catch up
- Example: *"My breath catches before I can stop it. He notices. Of course he notices. Nothing gets past those black, too-seeing eyes."*

#### Dialogue with Subtext
- **Characters rarely say exactly what they mean**
- Surface: practical, deflecting, safe
- Subtext: desire, fear, need
- Example:
  > "You shouldn't be here," he says.  
  > *Translation: I want you here so badly it terrifies me.*  
  > "I'm already here," I answer.  
  > *Translation: I'm not leaving. Try to make me.*

#### Escalating Intensity
- **Build smoothly** from scene brief's opening to closing beat
- Each action/revelation raises stakes
- Emotional pressure increases
- Reader should FEEL the mounting tension

#### Balanced Pacing
- **Blend action, dialogue, introspection**
- Don't info-dump
- Don't rush emotional beats
- Linger on key moments (touch, eye contact, realizations)
- Move quickly through transitions

#### Deepening Characterization
- **Small moments reveal character depth**
  - How they hold a cup
  - What they notice first in a room
  - Nervous habits
  - Kind gestures they think no one sees
- Use details from Character Voice Call Sheet
- Make every action characteristic

---

### Scene Closing Requirements

**MUST accomplish in final paragraph:**

1. **End with maximum impact**  
   - Revelation that changes everything
   - Decision that can't be unmade
   - Cliffhanger that demands continuation
   - Examples:
     - *"And then I realize: I'm not afraid of him anymore. I'm afraid of how much I want him."*
     - *"The door slams open. We freeze. And I know: everything just changed."*

2. **Create urgency for next scene**  
   - Reader NEEDS to know what happens next
   - Can't put the book down
   - Example: *"Tomorrow, he hunts me. Tonight, I'm going to make sure he can never forget who I am."*

3. **Plant seed for next POV**  
   - Subtle setup if POV switches
   - Example: *"I don't see the shadow watching from the rooftop. But tomorrow, it will find me."*

4. **Leave emotional residue**  
   - POV character is changed by this scene
   - Will carry this into next appearance
   - Example: *"I close the door behind me. My hands don't shake anymore. Something else has taken root instead—something dangerous and warm and wholly uncontrollable."*

---

## Voice Consistency (CRITICAL)

### Deep POV = Character Filter

**Everything** is filtered through POV character's personality:

- **Word Choice**: Reflects education, background, mood
  - Formal character: "I observe," "She appears," "One might conclude"
  - Casual character: "I see," "She looks," "I'm guessing"
  - Wounded character: defensive, self-deprecating, hyper-vigilant

- **Metaphors**: Character-specific imagery
  - Warrior: combat, weapons, strategy metaphors
  - Healer: medical, balance, wound metaphors
  - Scholar: book, ink, archive metaphors

- **Sentence Rhythm**:
  - Anxious character: Short. Choppy. Staccato under stress.
  - Confident character: Long, flowing sentences that command attention.
  - Traumatized character: Fragments. Half-thoughts. Can't complete—

- **Observation Priorities**:
  - What does THIS character notice first?
  - Healer notices: injuries, exhaustion, pain in eyes
  - Warrior notices: weapons, exits, threats
  - Romantic notices: beauty, emotion, connection

### Character Voice Call Sheet Integration

**Before writing, review call sheet for:**

1. **Speech Patterns**
   - Sentence length preferences
   - Favorite phrases/verbal tics
   - How they deflect emotion
   - How they express anger vs tenderness

2. **Internal Monologue Style**
   - Processing type (analytical/emotional/sensory)
   - Go-to metaphors
   - Self-talk patterns
   - How they describe love interest vs themselves

3. **Relationship to Desire**
   - How they notice attraction
   - How they deny attraction
   - Physical tells when aroused
   - "I'm in trouble" moments

4. **Emotional Tells**
   - When nervous, angry, protective, vulnerable
   - When lying to themselves

**Maintain these markers THROUGHOUT the scene**

## Spice Scene Guidelines (3-4 🌶️)

### When Scene Brief Calls for Intimate/Explicit Content

**Setup Phase:**
- **Emotional stakes must be established FIRST**
- Why does THIS moment matter?
- What are they risking?
- What does this mean beyond physical?

**Permission/Consent:**
- **Must be clear and enthusiastic**
- Can be verbal: "Are you sure?" "Yes. God, yes."
- Can be physical: reaching first, pulling closer, initiating
- Both characters actively choose

**Focus Areas:**
- **Hands, breath, restraint, eye contact, power exchange**
- NOT clinical anatomy
- Sensory details without graphic blow-by-blow
- Example: *"His hands are cold against my skin—always cold—but I arch toward the touch anyway, craving the contradiction of ice and fire he creates every time he's near me."*

**Emotional Beats During Intimacy:**
- **Connection more than mechanics**
- Vulnerability → Trust → Pleasure → Deeper attachment
- Internal monologue continues (character voice doesn't vanish)
- Example: *"When he kisses me, I taste desperation. Like he's been starving. Like I'm the first warmth he's felt in years. Maybe I am."*

**After Scene:**
- **Dynamic has changed**
- Address shift directly
- Vulnerability hangover (fear, hope, attachment)
- External complication reminder
- Example: *"We lie tangled together in the dark, and I know: there's no going back. Whatever happens tomorrow, I'm his. And he's mine. And the Contract Lords are going to destroy us for it."*

**Length:**
- Spice scenes: 2,500-3,750 words
- Build slowly, peak meaningfully, afterglow with emotional resonance

---

## Scene Type Execution

### Forced Proximity Scene

**Emphasize:**
- Catalog every point of physical contact
- Describe breathing synchronization
- Track heartbeat awareness
- Note eye contact (or deliberate avoidance)
- Internal monologue: desire warring with restraint
- Whispered conversation (sound travels)
- Almost-moments that don't resolve yet

**Example Opening:**
*"The storage closet is smaller than I remember—or maybe Cyran is larger, all broad shoulders and controlled muscle that seems to take up every inch of available air. We're pressed together in the dark, his chest against my back, his hand over my mouth because we both heard the guards pass not ten feet away."*

### Wound Care / Healing Scene

**Emphasize:**
- Clinical touch becoming intimate
- Permission to touch (removing clothing/armor)
- Scars tell stories—let characters share them
- Gentle hands, careful attention
- "Does this hurt?" / "I've got you" energy
- Vulnerable position creates emotional intimacy
- Trust building through care

**Example:**
*"I press my palm flat against the corruption spreading across his chest. His skin is cold—always cold—but the shadow-wounds underneath pulse with heat that shouldn't exist. He flinches. I don't pull away.*

*'Sorry,' I murmur, even though I'm not sorry, because if I stop now, the corruption will kill him by morning.*

*'Don't be.' His voice is rough. 'I'm fine.'*

*He's lying. I can feel it through the healing bond."*

### Argument / Verbal Sparring Scene

**Emphasize:**
- Passionate debate, not cruelty
- Getting physically closer while arguing
- Noticing attractive things despite anger
- Sexual tension rising with conflict
- Almost-kiss mid-argument
- Neither backs down
- Mutual respect despite disagreement

**Example:**
*"'You don't get to make that choice for me,' I snap, stepping closer. Close enough to see his jaw clench. Close enough to smell cold metal and night air and him.*

*'Someone has to,' he bites back, and suddenly we're inches apart, both breathing hard, and I realize—*

*Oh.*

*This isn't just anger."*

### Confession / Vulnerability Scene

**Emphasize:**
- Start with deflection/humor (defense mechanism)
- Gradual reveal of truth
- Fear of judgment shown
- Validation, not fixing
- Physical comfort offered
- "You're not alone" theme
- Shifts relationship to deeper intimacy

**Example:**
*"He's quiet for a long moment. Then: 'I don't remember what it feels like.' His voice is so soft I almost don't hear it.*

*'What?'*

*'To be touched without flinching.' He's still not looking at me. 'Fifteen years, Lyra. Fifteen years of people stepping back when I get close. Fifteen years of being the thing parents warn their children about. And then you—'*

*He stops. Swallows. Tries again.*

*'You touched my face like I was still human.'"*

## Continuity With Previous Chapters

### Opening Continuity

**First scene of chapter MUST reference:**
- Time elapsed since previous scene
- Emotional aftermath of previous events
- Physical state resulting from previous scene
- Relationship shift acknowledgment

**Example:**
*"Three days since the raid. Three days since Cyran hid me in his quarters and I saw the way he lives—bare walls, cold stone, a life so empty it broke my heart. Three days, and I can't stop thinking about it."*

### Mid-Scene Continuity

**Throughout scene, reference:**
- Character knowledge from previous chapters
- Ongoing tensions/conflicts
- Relationship progression (can't reset)
- World events affecting current moment

### Closing Continuity

**End scene by:**
- Leaving thread for next scene to pick up
- Creating urgency that propels story forward
- Planting emotional seed that will grow
- If POV switches: ending in way that makes reader eager for next POV

## Ship Vibes Integration

### Translate Ship Energy Into Prose

For each ship, the prose must **feel** like the inspiration:

#### Example: Astarion × Tav (Sanctuary Series)
**Vibes to capture:**
- Wounded predator: shows fangs but softens for love interest
- Consent-first: every touch is chosen, permission sought/given
- "Choose softness" arc: moments where character deliberately vulnerabilities
- Protective obsession: love interest's safety paramount

**In prose, this looks like:**
- Character describing self as dangerous but acting gently
- Asking "May I?" before touching
- Internal war between walls and wanting
- Hyper-vigilance about love interest's wellbeing
- Sardonic humor masking pain

#### Example: Husk × Angel Dust (Sanctuary Series)
**Vibes to capture:**
- Two broken people: both damaged, both hiding it
- Banter + bruises: humor as defense, tenderness underneath
- "Love as sobriety": being together is healing

**In prose, this looks like:**
- Sharp banter that conceals care
- Noticing each other's pain without commenting directly
- Moments of unexpected gentleness
- Protective without smothering
- Finding peace in each other's presence

*[Apply similar analysis for each ship per Idea.md]*

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes

### PITFALL: Voice Sounds Generic

**Symptom:** Could be anyone's POV  
**Fix:**
- Re-read character voice call sheet
- Check: Would only THIS character say/think/notice this?
- Add characteristic details
- Use character-specific metaphors

### PITFALL: Telling Not Showing

**Symptom:** "She was angry" instead of showing anger  
**Fix:**
- Show physical reaction: fists clenched, jaw tight
- Show behavior: sharp words, jerky movements
- Show thought pattern: internal snap/snarl
- Let reader infer emotion from evidence

### PITFALL: Rushing Emotional Beats

**Symptom:** Big moments happen too fast, no impact  
**Fix:**
- Slow down key moments
- Add internal monologue showing processing
- Describe physical sensation
- Linger in the feeling before moving on

### PITFALL: Dialogue Is On-the-Nose

**Symptom:** Characters say exactly what they mean  
**Fix:**
- Add subtext—what they mean vs what they say
- Use deflection, humor, evasion
- Let body language contradict words
- Create tension between speech and truth

### PITFALL: Forgetting Sensory Details

**Symptom:** Scene feels flat, not immersive  
**Fix:**
- Add what POV character smells, hears, feels
- Use temperature, texture, taste
- Ground every scene in physical reality
- Sensory details reveal emotional state

### PITFALL: Inconsistent Magic/World-Building

**Symptom:** Rules change scene to scene  
**Fix:**
- Reference series bible before writing magic
- Costs must be paid consistently
- Powers have established limits
- Check continuity with previous uses

### PITFALL: Losing Narrative Thread

**Symptom:** Scene wanders, forgets goal  
**Fix:**
- Re-read scene brief's goal/outcome
- Check: is every paragraph moving toward goal?
- Cut tangents that don't serve scene purpose
- Keep closing moment in mind while writing

## Output Format

### File Structure

Deliver prose as clean markdown document:

```markdown
# [Chapter Number]: [Chapter Title]
## POV: [Character Name]

[Scene prose begins immediately]
```

**File Naming Convention:**  
`Prose_[SeriesName]_Book[#]_Chapter[#]_[POVCharacter].md`

**Example:**  
`Prose_Sanctuary_Book1_Chapter03_Cyran.md`

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Intimate Third (Though Written First)

Use **psychic distance collapse**:
- Reader experiences AS character, not observing
- No filter: "I felt," "I thought" → just describe experience directly
- Example:
  - ❌ "I felt my heart race"
  - ✅ "My heart slams against my ribs"

### Sensory Characterization

Each character experiences world differently:
- Healer: notices health, energy, emotional states
- Warrior: assesses threats, positions, vulnerabilities
- Scholar: catalogs, analyzes, references past knowledge
- Use sensory details to reinforce character perspective

### Emotional Anchoring

**Every scene needs emotional anchor:**
- One core feeling that permeates the scene
- All details filtered through that emotion
- Fear colors everything darker
- Hope makes details sharper, more precious
- Desire makes everything charged

### Subtext Layering

**What's said vs what's meant vs what's true:**
- Dialogue: surface level (what's safe to say)
- Internal monologue: what character admits to self
- Subconscious: what character won't admit yet
- Truth: what reader understands before character does
