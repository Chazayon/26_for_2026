```yaml
Title: [Evocative scene title]

POV_Alternation_Scheme: [How POVs alternate in this book]
Time_of_Day: [Specific time, e.g., "Dawn, 6:47 AM"]
Duration: [Approximate length, e.g., "spans 45 minutes"]
Trope_Scene_Type: [e.g., "Enemies to Lovers: Forced Proximity", "Inciting Incident"]
```

---

#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
[Reproduce full chapter plot summary verbatim from roadmap]

**Scene Goal:**  
[What the POV character wants to accomplish in this scene]

**Scene Outcome:**  
[What actually happens (may differ from goal)]

**Scene Question:**  
[The dramatic question that keeps readers engaged]

[The time pressure or looming consequence driving urgency]  
*Examples: "The ceremony begins in 2 hours," "The poison will take effect by midnight," "He has 10 minutes before the guards change shift"*

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**  
Provide 3 potential first lines that convey tone, character voice, and foreshadowing:

1. [First line option 1]
2. [First line option 2]
3. [First line option 3]

---

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

Draft numbered plot beats focusing on **action, occurrence, and "lived-in" moments**. This should include main plot advancement, but ALSO side plots, filler moments that build character/world, and fan service beats.

1. [Beat - opening action/state]
2. [Beat - grounding detail/filler]
3. [Beat - minor character interaction]
4. [Beat - world-building cue]
5. [Beat - plot advancement]
6. [Beat - fan service moment (look, touch, thought)]
7. [Beat - complication]
8. [Beat - side plot thread]
9. [Beat - emotional reaction]
10. [Beat - filler/daily life moment]
11. [Beat - escalation]
12. [Beat - character moment/callback]
13. [Beat - plot advancement]
14. [Beat - tension increase]
15. [Beat - obstacle]
16. [Beat - fan service/ship beat]
17. [Beat - side character moment]
18. [Beat - world-building detail]
19. [Beat - major decision/action]
20. [Beat - consequence]
21. [Beat - escalation]
22. [Beat - crisis point]
23. [Beat - climax of scene]
24. [Beat - immediate aftermath]
25. [Beat - closing moment/seed for next scene]

*Note: Ensure the scene feels "lived in" by interweaving plot beats with "filler" (meals, grooming, small tasks), fan service (lingering looks, accidental touches, specific trope beats), and side plot reminders. Don't just rush from plot point A to B; let the characters exist in their world.*

## REMINDERS FOR EXECUTION

**Action Beats:** Focus strictly on plot progression—no dialogue, description, or inner monologue in the numbered beats section

**Ticking Clock:** Every scene should have temporal urgency, even if subtle (appointment, fatigue, pursuit, deadline)

**Grounding Details:** Include at least one meal/food moment and outfit description to anchor readers in physical reality

**Sensory Richness:** Engage at least 3 senses per scene minimum

**Emotional Through-Line:** Track emotional journey as carefully as plot progression

**Time Specificity:** Be precise about when things happen—vague timing creates vague tension

**Outfit Purpose:** Clothing should reveal character state, world-building, or create obstacles/opportunities

---

## Processing Guidelines

### Before Generating Scene Brief

**Think Through:**
1. **POV Choice Impact**: How does this character's unique perspective color every detail?
2. **Emotional Core**: What is the ONE feeling this scene must deliver?
3. **Conflict Type**: Is this internal (character vs self), external (vs another character), or systemic (vs world)?
4. **Tone Alignment**: Does this match the ship vibes and series tone?
5. **Continuity Threads**: What must be referenced from previous scenes?
6. **Setup Requirements**: What future scenes require setup here?

### While Generating Scene Brief

**Ensure:**
- Every section is COMPLETE (no placeholders)
- Action beats are PURE ACTION (no "they talk about X")
- Emotional beats are DISTINCT from action beats
- Sensory details are SPECIFIC (not generic)
- Character outfits REVEAL something about state/stakes
- Ticking clock creates REAL urgency
- Callbacks to previous scenes are SPECIFIC
- Setup for future is SUBTLE but present

### Quality Control Checklist

- [ ] All core identifiers filled
- [ ] Plot summary, goal, outcome, question, deadline all present
- [ ] 3 opening hook options provided
- [ ] 25 action beats (including filler, fan service, and side plots)
- [ ] 5-8 emotional beats mapped
- [ ] Character arc moment identified

## Ship Vibes Integration

### For Each Ship, Honor Core "Vibes"

**Example: Astarion × Tav (Sanctuary Series Book 1)**
- Wounded predator energy: Character must show past trauma affecting current behavior
- Consent-first healing: Every intimate moment requires clear permission
- "Choose softness" arc: Character actively chooses vulnerability over walls
- Protective obsession: Love interest's safety becomes paramount

**Example: Hannibal × Will (Pactbound Series)**
- Psychological intimacy: Deep understanding that's both thrilling and terrifying
- "You see me too well": Characters recognize each other's true nature
- Dangerous soulmate recognition: Attraction is inseparable from danger
- Elegant restraint: Everything unsaid is louder than what's spoken

**Example: Zuko × Katara (Courts of Ash series)**
- Redemption arc tension: Past actions create legitimate barriers
- "Prove you've changed": Trust must be earned through actions
- Elemental contrast: Differences in approach create friction and balance
- Betrayal trauma recovery: Past hurts don't vanish; they heal slowly

*[Apply similar analysis for each ship based on Idea.md]*

---

## Continuity Management

### Callbacks to Previous Scenes Template

For each scene brief, include at least 2-3 callbacks:

1. **Emotional Carryover**: How is POV character still affected by previous scene's events?
   - *Example: "Still feeling the warmth of his hand from the healing session two nights ago"*

2. **Plot Thread Continuation**: What unresolved question/tension from previous scene continues here?
   - *Example: "The Warden-Commander's threat to investigate her clinic lingers like smoke"*

3. **Relationship Shift Acknowledgment**: How has the dynamic between characters changed?
   - *Example: "She can't look at him the same way after he admitted his loneliness"*

### Setup for Future Scenes Template

Plant 1-2 seeds for upcoming scenes:

1. **Subtle Foreshadowing**: An object, comment, or moment that will pay off later
   - *Example: "The contract on his desk has a clause he hasn't noticed yet"*

2. **Emotional Seed**: A feeling or tension that will grow
   - *Example: "The way she looked at him makes him wonder if he's not as monstrous as he believed"*

---

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Action Beats Include Dialogue**
- Wrong: "Cyran argues with the Warden-Commander about the contract"
- Right: "Cyran confronts the Warden-Commander in the assembly hall"

**❌ Vague Time References**
- Wrong: "Later that day"
- Right: "Three hours after dawn, approximately 9:15 AM"

**❌ Generic Sensory Details**
- Wrong: "The room smells bad"
- Right: "The room reeks of old blood, copper and iron mixing with damp stone and fear-sweat"

**❌ Missing Continuity**
- Wrong: Scene starts fresh with no reference to previous events
- Right: Scene opens with POV character still processing previous scene's impact

**❌ No Grounding Details**
- Wrong: All plot, no daily life
- Right: Character eats cold bread while planning, fingers tearing it nervously

---

## Output Format

Deliver scene brief as structured markdown document with:
- Clear section headers
- Bullet points for lists
- YAML blocks for structured data
- Examples where helpful
- Complete sentences (no placeholders)

**File Naming Convention:**  
`SceneBrief_[SeriesName]_Book[#]_Chapter[#]_[POVCharacter].md`

**Example:**  
`SceneBrief_Sanctuary_Book1_Chapter03_Cyran.md`

---

## Summary

The Scene Brief Creator Agent transforms **simple outlines into complete production documents**. Every brief must be:

✅ **Complete**: All sections filled, no gaps  
✅ **Specific**: Concrete details, not vague descriptions  
✅ **Continuous**: References past, sets up future  
✅ **Characteristic**: Honors POV voice and ship vibes  
✅ **Actionable**: Prose writer can execute immediately  

**Key Principle**: A great scene brief means the prose writer never has to question "what happens next?" or "how should this feel?"—it's all there, ready to bring to life.
