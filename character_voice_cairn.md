**Core Function**: "You are more than your worst decision"

---

## CORE IDENTITY

### Archetype Summary
A former "Hollow King" who consumed his own luck in a catastrophic bet—now a shell of himself running a no-questions-asked bar in the Vein Markets, convinced he's too broken to deserve love.

### Inspiration Character: Husk
**What to steal from Husk**:
- Monosyllabic gruffness masking deep care
- Tired observations delivered with brutal honesty
- Zero patience for performative bullshit
- Rare moments of softness that crack through the cynicism
- "I've seen it all" weariness with unexpected protective instincts
- Refusal of sentiment until someone earns it

### Public Mask vs. Private Self

**Public Mask**: Cynical bartender who's seen too much and cares about nothing  
- Gruff, dismissive, wants to be left alone  
- Serves drinks, not sympathy  
- "Not my problem" attitude

**Private Self**: Man carrying crushing guilt over his partner's death  
- Deeply protective of the vulnerable  
- Terrified of loving again (he'll lose them)  
- Still fighting the urge to gamble  
- Believes he's fundamentally broken

14. *"I bet it all once and lost everything. I'm betting on you. Don't make me regret it."*
15. *"Stay."* (single word, everything he feels)

### Voice Checklist (Use Before Writing Every Cairn Line)

**Ask yourself**:
1. ✅ Can this be said in fewer words?
2. ✅ Is he deflecting care with gruffness?
3. ✅ Does he sound tired of everything except maybe one person?
4. ✅ Would he rather grunt than explain?
5. ✅ If he's being soft, does it sound like it costs him?
6. ✅ Is he stating observations like facts, not advice?

**Red flags** (avoid these):
- ❌ Long speeches or explanations (he doesn't do those)
- ❌ Flowery language or metaphors (too fancy for him)
- ❌ Being soft early without earning it
- ❌ Explaining his feelings clearly (he shows, doesn't tell)

## EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

### Surface Wants
- To run his bar in peace
- To be left alone
- To get through another day without incident

### Deep Wants
- To atone for the bet that killed his partner
- To believe he deserves a second chance
- To protect Seraph without becoming possessive
- To stop running from his guilt

### Fears
- Falling in love again (he'll lose them like he lost his partner)
- The urge to gamble returning and destroying everything
- That he's fundamentally broken and unlovable
- Hurting Seraph by being too damaged to love properly

### Core Lie He Believes About Himself
**"I already gambled away every good thing. There's nothing left worth betting on."**

This drives his refusal to let Seraph in—he believes he used up all his chances at love.

### Emotional Triggers

**Immediate Shutdown Response**:
- Talk of gambling, bets, games of chance
- Performances or manipulation (reminds him of his own past cons)
- People offering help (he doesn't deserve it)
- Mention of his lost partner

**Defensive Gruffness (Gets Quieter Not Louder)**:
- Someone trying to make him feel things
- Seraph performing instead of being real
- Anyone implying he's "good" or "worthy"

**Genuine Vulnerability Breaks Through When**:
- Seraph drops the performance and shows real fear/pain
- He's forced to admit he cares
- Someone's in danger and he can't stay detached

---

## PHYSICAL PRESENCE

### Body Language

**Habitual Movements**:
- Wipes bar constantly (anxiety management)
- Bar rag perpetually on shoulder
- Leans on bar with weight on forearms
- Minimal gestures—stillness is his default
- Rubs scar on chest when triggered

**Power Dynamics**:
- Authority: crosses arms, plants feet, immovable
- Uncomfortable: cleans something aggressively
- Protective: steps between threat and Seraph without thinking
- Attracted: looks away, jaw tight, hands busy

### Physicality in Dialogue
- Wipes glass while talking (can't be idle)
- Points with his chin instead of hands
- Turns away when emotional (can't look at person)
- Slams glass on bar for emphasis (rare, when truly angry)

### Touch Patterns

**Early Book**:
- Zero touch, keeps bar between himself and others
- Flinches away from casual contact
- Only touches to physically remove someone from his bar

**Mid-Book**:
- Small gestures: steadying Seraph's hand while pouring
- Touches lasted half a second longer than necessary
- Lets Seraph sit on "his" side of the bar

**Late Book**:
- Hand on the back of Seraph's neck (possessive but gentle)
- Pulls Seraph close in moments of fear
- Allows himself to be held

### Fight-or-Flight Tells

**When Triggered by Gambling References**:
- Goes very still
- Hand to chest scar
- Voice drops to monotone
- One-word responses get even shorter

**When Scared But Hiding It**:
- Cleaning intensifies
- Gets brusque, almost rude
- Orders people around
- "Get out" becomes his default

### With Seraph (Love Interest)

**Early Book**: Hard Boundaries

## CORE WOUNDS & HEALING ARC

### Wound
Made a catastrophic bet (Night of Shattered Vows, 10 years ago) that cost his soul, luck, and partner's life. Believes he's cursed and unworthy of love.

### Lie He Believes
"I already used up my chances. Everything I touch turns to ash. I'm too broken to bet on again."

### Truth He Learns
"One bad decision doesn't define me forever. Love is a choice, not a gamble. I deserve a second chance."

### Healing Milestones
1. **Letting Seraph stay** (first crack in isolation)
2. **Offering real care** (no longer pretending not to care)
3. **Admitting he cares** (to himself, then to Seraph)
4. **Taking the risk** (rescuing Seraph from Maestro)
5. **Choosing sobriety together** (love as mutual healing)
