#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
A few weeks later. The city is different—the oppressive "Contract Weight" is lighter since the Node broke. Lysa has new quarters (independent). Cyran is visiting (virtually living there). It's a quiet evening. Lysa is working on drafts for new laws. Cyran is pretending to read but is actually just watching her. He feels a sudden panic—a "too good to be true" dread. *When does the other shoe drop?* He confesses this to her. *"I don't know how to do this. Normal. Happy."* She puts down her pen. She doesn't promise forever; she promises *now*. *"It might end. Everything does. That doesn't mean we don't try."* He accepts the present. They cook dinner together (badly).

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Learn to exist in peace.

**Scene Outcome:**  
He accepts happiness as a valid state.

**Scene Question:**  
Can a weapon be a person? (Answer: Yes, with practice).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
None. The pacing is slow intentionally.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *She chews her quill when she's thinking. I want to be that quill.*
2. *The silence in this room isn't heavy. It's just... quiet. I'm not used to it.*
3. *Peace is harder than war. In war, you know what to do with your hands.*

19. "Orbiting stars is simple physics. It's also terrifying."
