#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Thessen, exposed and enraged, attacks with both magic and blade. He summons Temple Guardians (statues). Lysa holds them off with the stolen stun-mace and wits. Cyran faces Thessen one-on-one. Thessen taunts him with the Command Key words, trying to make him flinch. Cyran uses the "sharpness" Lysa reminded him of in Ch 15. He doesn't fight like a duelist; he fights like an assassin. He takes a hit to get close, then drives the obsidian dagger (the one meant for Varos) into Thessen's heart. As Thessen dies, his blood turns black—corrupted by the Prime Contract. He whispers: *"The debt remains."* His death releases a shockwave that cracks the Temple floor.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Kill Thessen.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Thessen is dead. Cyran is injured but victorious.

**Scene Question:**  
Is Cyran strong enough to kill his maker?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The Guardians are overwhelming Lysa.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *He taught me how to hold a knife. It seems only fair I return the lesson.*
2. *Thessen screams like a man who has never been told 'no' in his life.*
3. *I am not trembling anymore. I am steady as the grave.*
