#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Post-demonstration, Cyran is shaking. Thessen is busy boasting to investors about the "Reliability" of the asset. Lysa sees Cyran's mask crumbling—he's hyperventilating subtly. She knows if he stays, he'll snap or reveal the fake kill. She needs a distraction. She uses her stun-baton (overloaded) on the main fuse-box/magic-node of the hall. The lights blow. Chaos. In the dark, she grabs Cyran. They flee through the confusion, evading guards. They reach the terrace and jump to a lower balcony (action beat). They escape into the night.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Extract Cyran safely.

**Scene Outcome:**  
They escape the Gala. Cyran is mentally compromised (panic attack pending).

**Scene Question:**  
Can they get out before the lights come back on?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The emergency lights are flickering on.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *A hero waits for the right moment. I just break things.*
2. *Cyran looks like he's made of glass that's already shattered but hasn't fallen yet.*
3. *I pull the baton from my sleeve. Sorry, Lord Thessen. Party's over.*
