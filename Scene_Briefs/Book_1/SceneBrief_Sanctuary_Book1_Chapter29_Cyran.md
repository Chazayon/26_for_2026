#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Cyran is back in his old quarters in the Temple. It's not a dungeon; it's worse. It's the luxurious room he grew up in. Varos visits, bringing food and soft words ("Welcome home"). Cyran is numb. He expects torture, but the "kindness" breaks him down faster. He sits on the bed and hallucinates/remembers Lysa. He replays their moments: the first patrol, the tunnel, the feeding, the last night. He realizes that by leaving, he has isolated himself exactly as Varos wanted. *He* built the cage this time. The realization ignites a tiny spark of rage. He isn't the same boy who left years ago. He has been loved. That changes the math.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Survive the solitude without losing his mind.

**Scene Outcome:**  
He moves from despair to determination.

**Scene Question:**  
Is he the Relic or Cyran?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The Binding Ritual is coming (Ch 31).

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The silk sheets are exactly as I remember them. They smell of lavender and suffocation.*
2. *Varos smiles like a father who just drowned the kittens.*
3. *I reach for her in the dark, and my hand hits velvet wall-paper.*

13. He shuts his eyes. "Get out of my head."
14. Memory Flash: The feeding in Ch 9. The trust.
15. He sinks to the floor.
16. "I ruined it," he whispers.
17. But the memory persists. Her voice: *"You are not what they made you."*

19. These hands held her. These hands were gentle.
20. A Relic can't be gentle.
21. Therefore, he is not a Relic.

23. Considers the window (barred).
24. Considers the door (magic lock).
