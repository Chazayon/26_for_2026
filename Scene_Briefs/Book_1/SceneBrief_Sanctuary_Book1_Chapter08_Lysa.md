#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Back in the city, Tribunal pressure mounts. Thessen has made plans for the Gala. Cyran, assuming the inevitable (and maybe misreading the intimacy of the tunnel), invites Lysa to his quarters again. This time, no pretense: rich atmosphere, him as the perfected weapon/ornament. He makes the explicit transactional offer: *"You want my cooperation; I want your kindness on record. We both know what I'm good at trading."* Lysa is hit with full temptation—she wants him—but the way he offers it makes her sick. She refuses hard—not just "no," but a moral stand: *"I won't be one more name on the list of people who took you like a favor."* He masks hurt with sarcasm. She leaves angry, flustered, and admits internally she's attracted to him.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Stop him from selling himself.  
Cyran (In scene): Sell himself to secure the audit outcome.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Lysa refuses the transaction, unintentionally validating Cyran's belief that he is only worth what he can trade, and if that's rejected, *he* is rejected.

**Scene Question:**  
Can Lysa explain her refusal without breaking him? (Answer: No, not yet).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The implicit timeline of the audit finishing.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *He is wearing the silk shirt again. The one that looks like it was woven from spiderwebs and bad decisions.*
2. *There is a specific kind of silence that happens before a man sells his soul.*
3. *I thought we were past this. I was wrong.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Lysa enters Cyran's quarters. It's different tonight—dimmer, more scented.
2. Cyran is waiting by the fire. Staged. Perfect.
3. He pours wine without asking. "To survival," he toasts.
4. She doesn't drink. "We need to talk about the report."
5. "The report is finished," he says, moving closer. "Voss is happy. Thessen is happy."
6. "I'm not," she says.
7. He stops. "No. You're the difficult one."
8. He sets his glass down. deliberate movement.
9. "You kept me warm in the tunnel," he says softly.
10. "That was survival," she says, voice tight.
11. "Was it?" He steps into her space.
12. "I know how this works, Lysa." (First use of her name).
13. "You want compliance. I want... not to be destroyed."
14. His hand comes up to touch her face. Knuckles brushing cheek.
15. She trembles—attraction firing.
16. "We both know what I'm good at trading," he whispers.
17. The words act like ice water.
18. She grabs his wrist. Stops the hand.
19. "Stop."
20. He freezes. "Am I reading the signal wrong? You want this."
21. "I want *you*," she thinks. But says: "I don't want to buy you."
22. She drops his hand. "I won't be one more name on the list of people who took you like a favor."
23. The line lands like a slap. His face goes blank.
24. He steps back. The mask slams down—harder than before.
25. "A moralist," he sneers. "How tedious."
26. "It's not morality," she argues. "It's respect."
27. "Respect?" He laughs—brittle sound. "Respect doesn't keep me alive. Usefulness does."
28. "Find another use," she snaps.
29. She turns to the door. Needs to leave before she cries or screams.
30. "Get out," he says calmly.
31. She leaves.

*Note: The tragedy is that they both want the same thing (connection) but the method destroys it.*
