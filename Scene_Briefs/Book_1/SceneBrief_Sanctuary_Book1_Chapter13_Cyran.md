#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
In the main hall, Thessen announces the entertainment. He brings out a "feral" beast (actually a drugged prisoner/criminal). He commands Cyran to demonstrate his "Vigilance" by executing the threat. It's a test of obedience in front of the investors. Cyran steps into the circle. He sees the prisoner is terrified, not feral. He has to choose: kill an innocent and maintain cover, or refuse and die. He chooses a third path. He "dances" with the prisoner, making it look like a deadly duel, but whispering instructions to the man (*"Fall when I shove you. Stay down."*). He delivers a "killing blow" that is actually a precise, non-lethal nerve strike. The crowd applauds the "death." Thessen looks suspicious but satisfied. Cyran feels sick.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Fake the kill without being discovered.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Cyran successfully fakes the execution, saving the prisoner but traumatizing himself further.

**Scene Question:**  
Can Cyran fool Thessen?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The combat is happening *now*.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Thessen hands me a sword like he's handing me a pen. Sign here, in red.*
2. *The circle is drawn in salt and crushed bone. I know this stage.*
3. *The crowd wants blood. I have to give them a show instead.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Thessen claps. "And now, the demonstration!"
2. Guards drag a man into the center. Chained. Drugged.
3. Thessen introduces him as a "City-Killer" (lie).
4. He turns to Cyran. "Show them why you are the Relic."
5. Cyran steps forward. The crowd hushes.
6. He draws his glass dagger (from boot) or stage weapon.
7. He circles the prisoner.
8. The prisoner weeps. "Please."
9. Cyran leans close, masking it as a taunt. "Listen to me."
10. "I'm going to cut the chain. Swing at me."
11. The prisoner blinks. Confused.
12. Cyran slashes—cutting the chain link. Sparks fly.
13. "Fight!" Cyran roars (performance).
14. The prisoner swings clumsily.
15. Cyran dodges, spins. The crowd gasps. "Beautiful!"
16. Cyran whispers again. "On three. Fall left."
17. They trade blows—all choreographed by Cyran's speed.
18. He nicks the prisoner's arm—just enough blood for show.
19. "Three," Cyran hisses.
20. He thrusts the dagger under the armpit (nerve pinch).
21. The prisoner collapses, looking dead.
22. Cyran stands over him. Panting.
23. Silence.
24. Then applause. Thunderous.
25. Thessen walks up. Kicks the body. The prisoner doesn't move (paralyzed).
26. "Efficient," Thessen says. "But messy."
27. "You wanted a show," Cyran says, wiping the blade.
28. He looks for Lysa. She is pale. She knows.
29. "Take the trash away," Thessen commands guards.
30. Cyran sheathes the blade. His hands are trembling.

*Note: The tension is "Will the prisoner spoil the act?"*

#### **Emotional Architecture**

**Emotional Beats (5-8 Key Moments):**

1. **Dread:** Realizing the task.
2. **Analysis:** Assessing the prisoner (not a threat).
3. **Calculation:** Planning the fake.
4. **Performance:** Acting the killer.
5. **Fear:** That the prisoner won't follow the lead.
6. **Relief:** It worked.
7. **Self-Loathing:** The applause makes him feel dirty.
8. **Connection:** Seeing Lysa understands.

**Character Arc Moment:**  
Cyran uses his skills to *save* rather than *kill*, subverting his role as a weapon.

**Relationship Dynamics:**  
**Public:** Cyran is a monster.
**Private (Lysa):** She sees the mercy in the strike.

**Subtext Layer:**  
Thessen thinks he owns a dog; he actually owns a wolf who learned to pick locks.
