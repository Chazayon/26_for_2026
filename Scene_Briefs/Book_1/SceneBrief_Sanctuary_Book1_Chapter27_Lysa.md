#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
The Temple begins to shake (Thessen's death triggered a structural/magical collapse). Varos (the High Priest Cyran almost executed) stands up, shaken but alive. He realizes Thessen betrayed the faith. He shows Lysa and Cyran a secret exit behind the altar. "Go. I will hold the guards." Lysa helps the injured Cyran. They flee through the catacombs as the ceiling starts to crack. They emerge into the cool night air of the graveyard district. They collapse against a tombstone, alive.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Get Cyran to safety.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Escape successful. Varos becomes an ally (off-screen).

**Scene Question:**  
Can they outrun the collapse?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
Falling debris.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The god is angry, or maybe just indigestion. The floor is pitching like a ship.*
2. *Varos looks at the dead Lord and then at us. "Run," he says. A sensible priest.*
3. *Cyran is heavy on my shoulder, bleeding black dust and red blood.*
