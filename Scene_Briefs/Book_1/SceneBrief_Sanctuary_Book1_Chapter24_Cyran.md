#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
The Ceremony is in full swing. The High Priest Varos is chanting at the Heart-Altar. Thessen stands to the side, masking his glee. Cyran walks down the aisle, dressed in white, staring straight ahead. To the crowd, he looks like a devout guardian. Inside, he is screaming. He reaches the altar. Thessen gives the signal (a nod). Cyran's body moves. He draws the blade. He steps behind Varos. He raises the knife. He tries to stop—straining every muscle. The knife trembles but doesn't stop. He is seconds away from murder.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Stop the hand.

**Scene Outcome:**  
He fails to stop. The knife is poised to strike.

**Scene Question:**  
Will he kill Varos?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The blade is descending.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The chanting is a heartbeat, deep and slow. My own heart is a hummingbird.*
2. *I am a statue of white silk and black purpose.*
3. *I can see the vein in Varos's neck. I know exactly how it will pop.*
