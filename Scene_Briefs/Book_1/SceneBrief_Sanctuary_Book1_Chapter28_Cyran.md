#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They rest in the Necropolis as dawn breaks. Lysa checks Cyran's wounds. The magic blast burned his shoulder, but he's healing slowly. They sit against a crypt. The adrenaline fades, leaving clarity. Cyran looks at his hands—hands that killed his master. He feels... light. Terrified, but light. He thanks Lysa for the order to "Choose." It saved his soul. She confesses she was terrified he'd choose obedience. They kiss. Real, messy, desperate, life-affirming kiss. No magic, no transaction. Just gravity bringing them together.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Process his freedom.  
Lysa: Affirm the bond.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Romantic climax (The Kiss).

**Scene Question:**  
What does freedom taste like?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
None. The sun is rising (symbolic).

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *I am breathing. It is a voluntary action for the first time in years.*
2. *The dead make for quiet neighbors. I appreciate the privacy.*
3. *Her hands are covered in dust and Thessen's blood. I have never seen anything more beautiful.*

20. The kiss.
21. Taste of dust and blood and life.
22. He holds her like she's the only solid thing in the world.
23. They break apart. Foreheads resting together.
24. "So," he says. "What now?"
25. "Now we clear your name," she says.
26. "And then?"
27. "And then we find out who Thessen was working for."
