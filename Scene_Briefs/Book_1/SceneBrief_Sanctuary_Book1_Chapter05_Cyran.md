#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Lysa insists on shadowing Cyran during an actual patrol. They walk the ribcage district—citizens avoid them, fear him. A disturbance breaks out: a minor god-spawn attack in a market square. Cyran fights like art—deadly, theatrical, but this time protective of civilians, specifically shielding a child with his own body. He takes a wound (slice to the arm/side). Lysa tends the wound in the open street, hands steady but slightly trembling. He notices the tremble, misreads it as fear, and tries to charm/deflect ("I don't bite without invitation"). She snaps back ("Then consider this a permanent lack of invitation"), furious at herself for caring.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Complete the patrol without screwing up in front of the auditor.  
Secondary: Protect the civilians.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Cyran succeeds in the fight but fails to maintain emotional distance. Lysa sees his heroism.

**Scene Question:**  
Can Cyran maintain the "monster" persona when his actions prove he's a hero?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The combat is immediate urgency.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Walking the Ribcage with a scribe is like bringing a porcelain doll to a knife fight.*
2. *She wears practical boots tonight. I hate practical boots.*
3. *The city feels different when someone is watching. It feels like a stage.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Cyran and Lysa walk the bone-paved street. He sets a fast pace; she keeps up.
2. He points out "landmarks" (crime scenes). "That's where the marrow-thieves hang."
3. A group of citizens sees him and crosses the street.
4. Cyran waves mockingly. "Adoring fans."
5. Lysa notes the fear on her pad. He flinches internally.
6. They reach a market square—stalls selling bone-charms and gristle-skewers.
7. Atmosphere change: silence falls. Birds stop calling.
8. Cyran's hand goes to his daggers. "Stay here."
9. Lysa draws a small stun-baton (surprise!). "No."
10. Explosion of movement: a Scavenger-Beast bursts from a refuse pile.
11. Chaos: stalls overturned, people screaming.
12. Cyran engages—vaulting a cart, drawing aggro.
13. He taunts the beast, luring it away from the crowd.
14. The beast swipes; he dodges. "Sloppy!" he yells.
15. A child stumbled in the chaos—frozen in the beast's path.
16. Cyran sees the danger. Geometry calculation: he can't kill it in time.
17. He throws himself *between* the beast and the child.
18. Impact: Claws rake his arm/side. He grunts but holds ground.
19. He drives his dagger up under the beast's jaw. Kill shot.
20. The beast falls. Cyran kicks it off, wincing.
21. Silence returns. He turns to the child. "Run along, little morsel."
22. The child runs. Cyran checks his arm—bleeding freely.
23. Lysa is there instantly. "You're hit."
24. "Tis but a scratch," he quips, leaning on a crate.
25. She rips a strip from her spare tunic (or pulls a bandage).
26. She cleans the wound. Her hands shake.
27. He watches her hands. "Afraid of the blood, darling?"
28. She tightens the bandage hard. "Afraid of the stupidity. You could have died."
29. He blinks. "I'm the shield. That's the job."
30. "Don't bite without an invitation," he adds, falling back on script.
31. "Consider this a permanent lack of invitation." she snaps.
32. She ties the knot. Steps back.
33. He looks at the bandage. It's neat. Caring.
34. They walk away, silence heavier now.

*Note: The shift from combat (action) to tending (intimacy) is the core beat.*

#### **Emotional Architecture**

**Emotional Beats (5-8 Key Moments):**

1. **Performance:** Showing off for the auditor.
2. **Focus:** Combat takes over.
3. **Selflessness:** The choice to take the hit. Instinctive, not calculated.
4. **Pain:** The wound hurts, but the *shame* of being wounded in front of her is worse.
5. **Surprise:** She's angry *for* him, not at him.
6. **Deflection:** Using humor to hide that he's touched by her care.
7. **Rejection (Perceived):** Her "permanent lack of invitation" stings, even if he provoked it.
8. **Confusion:** She cares, but she rejects. He doesn't know this dance.

**Character Arc Moment:**  
Cyran acts as a Defender (Selfless) rather than a Relic (Object), contradicting his own belief that he matters only for pleasure/violence.

**Relationship Dynamics:**  
**Hurt-Comfort:** She tends him. The physical barrier breaks (she touches him to heal).

**Subtext Layer:**  
She's shaking because she was scared *for* him. He thinks she's scared *of* him.
