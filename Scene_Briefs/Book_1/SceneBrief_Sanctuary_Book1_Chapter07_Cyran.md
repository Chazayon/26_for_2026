#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
A collapse in the bone-tunnels traps Cyran and Lysa in a ribcage alcove overnight during a divine bone-dust storm. They are forced into a small shrine-alcove, sharing warmth. Conversation shifts from professional to personal. She asks why he jokes about everything; he deflects (*"It's better than crying"*). He asks why she distrusts monsters; she reveals past harm. Physical proximity: they share a cloak; her head nearly ends up on his shoulder. He offers a sincere line (*"I feel safer when you're the one judging me"*). She pulls back.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Survive the storm and the awkwardness of intimacy.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Shared vulnerability creates a bond that complicates the "prey/predator" dynamic.

**Scene Question:**  
What happens when the masks come off in the dark?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The storm outside is lethal (bone-shards). They *must* stay until morning.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The storm sounds like a thousand teeth chattering at once.*
2. *Ideally, I prefer my sleeping arrangements to have silk sheets and fewer auditors.*
3. *She shivers, and my first instinct is to burn the world to warm her. That is... concerning.*

---

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. The tunnel rumbles—bone-quake.
2. Cyran grabs Lysa and pulls her into the alcove just as the ceiling comes down.
3. Dust clouds choke the air. They cough, pressed together.
4. Silence falls. The exit is blocked by debris.
5. "Well," Cyran says, brushing dust off her shoulder. "Cozy."
6. Lysa tries the com-link. Static. "Storm interference."
7. They inspect the alcove: stone bench, old offerings (dried flowers), cold.
8. The temperature drops rapidly (storm effect).
9. Lysa rubs her arms. Cyran notices.
10. He unclasps his heavy cloak. "Take it."
11. She hesitates. "You'll freeze."
12. "I'm dead, darling. I run cold." (Half-truth).
13. She accepts it. Sits on the bench.
14. He stands guard at the blocked entrance (posturing).
15. Hours pass. The cold deepens. He starts shivering despite his boast.
16. "Sit down," she orders. "Share the cloak. Don't be a martyr."
17. He sits. Thigh to thigh.
18. She spreads the cloak over both of them.
19. Silence. Just breathing.
20. "Why the jokes?" she asks quietly. "Even when you're bleeding."
21. He looks at the ceiling. "If I stop laughing, I might remember I'm screaming."
22. She turns to him. "That's... honest."
23. "I have my moments."
24. He looks at her profile. "Why the audit? You hate this work."
25. "I hate the mistakes. I made one once. I won't again."
26. He rests his head back. "I feel safer when you're the one judging me."
27. The line hangs in the air.
28. Her head nods, heavy with sleep, brushes his shoulder.
29. He freezes. Doesn't move. Doesn't breathe.
30. She jerks awake. Pulls back. "Sorry."
31. "Sleep, Auditor. I'll watch the rocks."
32. She sleeps. He watches her face until dawn.

*Note: The physical progression mirrors the emotional opening.*

#### **Emotional Architecture**

**Emotional Beats (5-8 Key Moments):**

1. **Adrenaline:** The collapse.
2. **Awkwardness:** Trapped in small space.
3. **Chivalry:** Offering the cloak.
4. **Vulnerability (Physical):** The cold forces them together.
5. **Vulnerability (Emotional):** The confession about humor.
6. **Intimacy:** The "safer with you" line.
7. **Panic (Internal):** When she touches him. He wants it too much.
8. **Protective:** Watching her sleep.

**Character Arc Moment:**  
Cyran admits he uses humor as a defense mechanism—a huge step in self-awareness with an audience.

**Relationship Dynamics:**  
**Shift:** They become "Us" against the storm.

**Subtext Layer:**  
He wants to be held. She wants to hold him. Neither breaks the barrier.
