#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Lysa wakes up reaching for Cyran. He is gone. She finds the note. She reads it and immediately understands: he surrendered to Varos to protect her from the blackmail. She doesn't cry; she smashes a vase. She is furious that he made the choice for her. She needs a place to think where the Tribunal can't track her. She goes to Cairn's Bar. **Cairn** (Book 2 Lead) is there, cleaning glasses. He recognizes the look of a "Temple widow." He gives her a drink and unsolicited advice: *"When someone walks away to save you, the question is whether you let them. Are you a damsel or a partner?"* Lysa realizes she has to go get him.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Process the breakup and decide to fight.

**Scene Outcome:**  
She chooses action over despair.

**Scene Question:**  
Will she accept his sacrifice? (Answer: Hell no).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
He is already in the Temple's clutches.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The bed is cold. That's the first betrayal.*
2. *The note is short. Cowards are always brief.*
3. *I don't scream. I calculate.*
