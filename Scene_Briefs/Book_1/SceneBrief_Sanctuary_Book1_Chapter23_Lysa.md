#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Lysa arrives at the Temple District. The streets are crowded for the Great Pulse ceremony. She can't walk in the front door. She uses her knowledge of the city (audit maps) to find a maintenance entrance—the "Vein Ducts." Guards are posted. She doesn't sneak; she engages. She uses the stolen guard weapon (stun-mace) and her baton. She fights dirty—acid in a lock, knee-capping a guard. She is not a warrior, but she is desperate. She breaches the perimeter and enters the Temple underbelly, hearing the drums above. She knows she is late.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Enter the Temple.

**Scene Outcome:**  
She is inside, battered but moving.

**Scene Question:**  
Can she get to the altar in time?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The drums are accelerating.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *I am not built for war, but I am built for stubbornness, which is remarkably similar.*
2. *The Temple looms like a ribcage waiting to snap shut.*
3. *I have three vials of acid and zero patience.*
