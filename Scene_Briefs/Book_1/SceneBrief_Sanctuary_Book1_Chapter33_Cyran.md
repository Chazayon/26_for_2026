#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Varos lunges at Lysa. Lysa dodges, but she's not a warrior. She falls back. Cyran sees this. The sight of her in danger overrides the magical paralysis completely. The logic is simple: *Protect Her > Obey Him.* The "Protection" directive he carved into his own soul years ago is stronger than the "Obedience" directive Varos is using. Cyran screams—a raw, magical sound. The chains on his wrists shatter (or the stone altar cracks). He is free. He tackles Varos away from Lysa. He slams Varos into the stone floor. He stands up, shaking, glowing with residual magic. He summons his daggers (or grabs Varos's fallen blade). *"Motion denied,"* he growls.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Break the physical bonds.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Cyran is free and armed. Varos is pushed back to the altar.

**Scene Question:**  
Who owns Cyran? (Answer: No one).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The Heart-Node is speeding up again, angry at the interruption.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Seeing her bleed clarifies things. The universe narrows to a single point: Him.*
2. *The chains are iron. My rage is something harder.*
3. *I don't need a key. I am the key.*

*Note: The physical break is the manifestation of the psychological break.*

#### **Emotional Architecture**

**Emotional Beats (5-8 Key Moments):**

1. **Terror:** Seeing Lysa hurt.
2. **Rage:** The break.
3. **Power:** Feeling his own strength return.
4. **Protection:** Placing himself between her and Varos.
5. **Irony:** Using Varos's weapon against him.

**Character Arc Moment:**  
Cyran uses his "Protector" identity to override his "Slave" identity.

**Subtext Layer:**  
"Motion Denied" is a legal joke, showing his humor/personality is back.
