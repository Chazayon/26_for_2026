#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They attempt to move to a new safe house before the night's confrontation. They are ambushed in the street—not by random thugs, but by the Tribunal Guard (Lysa's own people), led by Voss. It's a betrayal on Lysa's home turf. Cyran fights ferociously (Sequence: *The Dancer of Death*), protecting Lysa. But they use sonic-cannons (Temple tech). Cyran is brought to his knees. Thessen steps out. He doesn't use the Key yet (saving it for the ceremony), but he uses sheer force. Voss arrests Lysa for treason. Cyran surrenders to stop them from hurting her. They are separated. Cyran is dragged away to the Temple. Lysa is thrown into a transport wagon aimed for the prison.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Fight the ambush.  
Cyran: Protect Lysa.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Total defeat. Cyran captured. Lysa arrested.

**Scene Question:**  
Is this the end?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The Ceremony is tonight.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *They waited until the sun was high. No shadows to hide in.*
2. *Cyran moves faster than thought, but he cannot punch sound.*
3. *Betrayal doesn't look like a villain in a mask. It looks like my boss, Voss, holding a warrant.*
