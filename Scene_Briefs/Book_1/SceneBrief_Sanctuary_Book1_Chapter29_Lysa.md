#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Three days later. The Tribunal is in chaos. Varos's testimony cleared Cyran and condemned Thessen. Voss is being arrested for conspiracy. Lysa stands in the Tribunal Hall, watching the shuffle. The new High Inquisitor offers her a promotion. She looks at the badge—the symbol of the system that failed her. She declines. She resigns. She walks out to meet Cyran on the steps. He is waiting in the sun (hooded). They are free agents now. But the mystery remains: Thessen was just a middle-man.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Sever ties with the corrupt system.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Lysa is unemployed but free.

**Scene Question:**  
What is the price of integrity? (Answer: Your job).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
None.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Justice moves slowly, except when there is a vacuum of power. Then it sprints.*
2. *Voss looks smaller in chains. Most men do.*
3. *I place my badge on the desk. It makes a heavy, final sound.*
