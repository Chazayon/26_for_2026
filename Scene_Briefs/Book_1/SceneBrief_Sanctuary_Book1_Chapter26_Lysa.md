#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Evidence has surfaced (planted by Thessen) that Cyran has been accepting bribes to cover up murders. A formal "Hearing" is called in the Hall of Truths. Lysa attempts to represent him but is barred at the door by Varos—claiming this is an "internal Temple matter" due to Cyran's origin. Inside, Cyran faces Varos and Thessen. It's not a trial; it's an ultimatum. Varos reveals they have fabricated proof that will destroy *Lysa's* career and imprison her for conspiracy if Cyran doesn't return to the Temple willingly. They don't want to kill him; they want him back. Cyran realizes he can't fight them legally without taking Lysa down with him. He leaves the chamber shaken, knowing he has to sacrifice himself.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Get into the room.  
Cyran: Protect Lysa from the fallout.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Cyran is cornered. The threat against Lysa forces his hand.

**Scene Question:**  
What will Cyran trade for Lysa's safety? (Answer: His freedom).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The "Verdict" will be delivered in 24 hours.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The Hall of Truths is built of transparent stone, so you can see the lies more clearly.*
2. *They stopped me at the door with a smile and a pike.*
3. *I can see him through the glass. He looks small.*
