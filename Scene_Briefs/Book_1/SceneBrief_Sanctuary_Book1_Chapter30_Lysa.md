#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Lysa follows a lead from Ilan's case notes to the Halo Ward Archives. She meets **Solen** (Book 4 Lead), a brilliant but paranoid archivist/researcher. Solen is barricaded in a tower of paper. He knows about Cyran and the Temple. He explains the "Binding Ritual" Varos is planning: it's not just obedience; it's fusing Cyran to the "Heart-Node" of the Prime Contract. Cyran will become a living battery for the city's corruption. Solen shows her the schematics. He points out a triangular glyph (**Cipher's sign**). Lysa asks how to stop it. Solen says: *"You can't untie the knot. You have to cut the throat."* He gives her the location of the Heart-Chamber and a scroll of ancient Counter-Law.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Find out how to save Cyran.

**Scene Outcome:**  
She has the plan (Book 1 Climax) and the context (Series Plot).

**Scene Question:**  
What is Cyran really being used for?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The Ritual is tonight.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The Halo Ward Archives smell like dust and paranoia.*
2. *Solen points a crossbow at me before he asks my name. I respect that.*
3. *The diagram on the desk looks like a city, or a cancer. It's the same thing.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

2. Navigating the labyrinth of books.
3. Finds the central desk.
4. *Click.* Solen aims a hand-crossbow.

9. Solen laughs nervously. "Come look."
10. Spreads a map.
11. "Here is the Temple. Here is the Heart-Node."
12. "Varos wants to plug him in here."
13. "Like... a battery?"
14. "Like a filter. He'll process the corruption. It will eat his soul in days."
15. Lysa feels sick. "How do we stop it?"
16. Solen traces a line. "The contract is legal. Magic respects law."
17. "But..." He pulls a scroll.
18. "If you prove the contract was signed under duress... the magic snaps."
19. "He was a child," Lysa says.
20. "Prove it," Solen says. "In the chamber. While the god watches."
21. He hands her the scroll. "Old Law. Use it."
22. He points to a Triangle Glyph in the corner.
23. "And watch out for Him. The Prime."
24. "Who?"
25. "Not today. Just... go."
26. Lysa takes the scroll.
27. "Thank you."
28. She runs.

*Note: Solen is the Ford Pines archetype—gruff, genius, tired.*
