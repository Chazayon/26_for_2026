#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
A serious attack on patrol (ambush by god-spawn). Cyran is gravely injured and dangerously blood-starved. He needs blood to heal. Usual donors are unreachable (or this is a trap to isolate him). Lysa is the only option. He tries to refuse—humiliated after her rejection in Ch 8 (*"I'll manage or die. Either is fine."*). She forces the issue, realizing she wants him to live. Negotiation in crisis: *"I'm offering this because I choose to... Not as payment."* The bite is charged, dangerous, erotic. For him: the first time he takes from someone who respects his boundaries.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Survive the wound without taking from her (pride).  
Lysa (Action): Keep him alive.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Cyran feeds from Lysa. It is intimate, consensual, and breaks the stalemate.

**Scene Question:**  
Can they intimacy exist without transaction?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
He is bleeding out. Healing is stalled by hunger.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Pain is a familiar room. I know where all the furniture is.*
2. *I am leaking life onto the cobblestones, which is inconveniently messy.*
3. *She is looking at me with that terrified, determined face again. I wish she'd leave.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Cyran stumbles into the safe house (an abandoned ossuary).
2. He collapses against a wall. Hand pressed to his side.
3. Blood is dark, soaking his leathers.
4. Lysa bars the door. "They're gone. We're safe."
5. She turns, sees the blood. "Cyran."
6. She rushes to him. "Let me see."
7. He pushes her hand away. Weakly. "Don't touch. I'm... hungry."
8. The Thirst is rising. His eyes are blown wide, red.
9. "You need to fix this," she says, tearing his shirt open.
10. The wound is deep. Ragged. Not closing.
11. "Can't," he gasps. "Empty. No reserves."
12. She realizes: he needs blood to fuel the regeneration.
13. "I'll fetch a donor," she says, standing.
14. "No time," he rasp. "Trap outside. You'll die."
15. She looks at the wound. It's getting worse.
16. She looks at him. Failing.
17. She exposes her wrist (or neck—neck is more intimate). Neck.
18. "Drink," she says.
19. He recoils. "No. You made it clear. Not a merchant."
20. "This isn't trade," she says fiercely. "This is medicine. This is choice."
21. She kneels. Presses closer. "Cyran. Please."
22. The scent of her blood hits him. Overwhelming.
23. "I might kill you," he whispers. "I can't control it."
24. "I trust you," she says.
25. That breaks him.
26. He pulls her down.
27. The bite. Sharp pain, then... bliss.
28. He drinks. It's not like the donors. It's warm. Alive. *Her.*
29. She gasps. Hands in his hair. Holding him close.
30. The wound starts to knit. Steam rising from his side.
31. He struggles to stop. The Thirst wants everything.
32. "Cyran," she says softly. "That's enough."
33. He forces himself to detach. Licks the wound closed.
34. He falls back, chest heaving. High on blood.
35. She stays close. Touching his face.
36. "You stayed," he marvels.
37. "I stayed," she confirms.

*Note: The feeding should be coded as sex/intimacy. The sensations overlap.*
