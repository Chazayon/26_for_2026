#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Varos is down, but the Heart-Node is going critical. It's overflowing with the energy Varos summoned. If it isn't discharged, it will level the district. Cyran feels the pull. He can "Connect" to it—take the power, become a God-King, and rule the city. It's tempting. He could fix everything. He could keep Lysa safe forever. He looks at the Node, then at Lysa helping Varos (dragging him to safety). He realizes being a god means being alone. He rejects the Ascension. Instead, he channels the energy into the floor—grounding it. He drives the dagger into the Node, acting as a lightning rod. The Node shatters. The shockwave hits him. Darkness.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Disarm the magical bomb.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Node destroyed. Cyran survives (barely). Prime Contract link severed.

**Scene Question:**  
Power or Humanity?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
Critical Mass imminent.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The heart of a god is a noisy thing.*
2. *Power tastes like honey and iron. It wants to be drunk.*
3. *I could snap my fingers and fix the world. But I'd lose my hands.*

14. Energy pours into him.
15. He screams.
16. Channels it down. Through his legs. Into the stone.

18. They shatter.
19. The Node turns gray. Dies.
20. Falls apart into ash.
21. The surge throws Cyran back.
22. He hits the wall.
23. Slides down.
24. Silence.
25. Lysa running to him.
26. "Cyran!"
27. He opens one eye.
28. "Did I... quit?"
29. She laughs/sobs. "You're fired."
30. He passes out.

*Note: The rejection of power is the true victory.*
