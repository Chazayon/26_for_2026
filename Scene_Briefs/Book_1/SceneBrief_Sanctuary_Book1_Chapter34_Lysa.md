#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Unless Cyran kills Varos, the ritual will keep trying to restart. Varos, cornered, rants about Order and Necessity. He claims Cyran is a monster who *needs* a leash. Lysa steps up. She deconstructs Varos's argument. She recounts the abuse, naming it clearly. She strips away his "Holy" veneer. Cyran has the knife at Varos's throat. He looks at Lysa. *"Do I finish it?"* Lysa looks at the broken priest. Killing him would be justice, but sparing him breaks the cycle. *"No,"* she says. *"He's not worth the stain on your soul. We take him in."* Cyran hesitates, then knocks Varos unconscious with the hilt. "You're lucky she's in charge," Cyran tells the unconscious body.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Define justice for Cyran.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Varos is defeated but alive. Cyran chooses mercy (growth).

**Scene Question:**  
Is Cyran a killer or a man?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The Heart-Node is thrashing violently above them.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *He looks small without his pulpit. Just an old man in fancy robes.*
2. *Cruelty is boring when you strip away the pomp.*
3. *Cyran holds the knife like he was born with it. I need him to put it down.*
