#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Lysa presents a neutral preliminary report to her superiors—and discovers the situation is more complicated. Contract Lord Thessen is present at the briefing. He has plans for Cyran: "special assignments" that sound exactly like his old temple exploitation. Tribunal members hint that Cyran is ideal for "donor relations." Lysa is disgusted but can't openly object yet. She visits **Cairn's Bar** (The Hollow King's Tavern) in the Vein Markets to drink and think. There, she witnesses a flamboyant performer (Seraph) flirting with everyone and a grumpy bartender (Cairn) ignoring it. She leaves before making contact, but the seeds are planted.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Survive the briefing without revealing her sympathy for Cyran; then decompress/think.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Lysa realizes the "audit" is a sham to clear Cyran for abuse; she finds a neutral space (the Bar) but remains isolated.

**Scene Question:**  
Who is actually pulling the strings on Cyran's life?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The "donor relations" program is moving forward fast.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Thessen smells like lavender and old money, a scent designed to mask the rot of his soul.*
2. *They don't want an audit; they want a brochure.*
3. *I speak the language of neutral bureaucracy, but today it tastes like ash.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Lysa stands before the committee: Voss, two junior scribes, and Lord Thessen.
2. Thessen is eating grapes. The wet sound echoes in the silence.
3. Lysa presents her findings: "Subject is efficient. Complaints are... contextual."
4. Voss nods. "Excellent. We can proceed with the Donor Gala then."
5. Lysa pauses. "Gala?"
6. Thessen smiles. "Wealthy patrons need... incentives. The Blood Relic is a potent incentive."
7. Lysa realizes: they want to pimp him out. Sanctioned by the state.
8. She keeps her face blank. "His file indicates volatility."
9. "That adds to the allure," Thessen says.
10. Meeting adjourned. Lysa is dismissed like a servant.
11. She walks out, shaking with suppressed rage.
12. She needs a drink. Not Tribunal wine. Real drink.
13. Travel: Takes a transport-capsule down to the Vein Markets.
14. The atmosphere shifts: darker, louder, alive.
15. She finds "The Hollow King's Tavern." Sign is a crown on a skull.
16. Enters. The smell of marrow-whiskey and sweat.
17. She takes a corner table. "Whiskey. Leave the bottle."
18. Observation: A pink, glowing figure (**Seraph**) dancing on the bar.
19. The bartender (**Cairn**) sighs and tosses a rag at him. "Down. You're scaring the regulars."
20. Seraph laughs. "They love me, grouchy."
21. Lysa watches them. They seem... free. Or at least honest.
22. A patron bumps her table. "You lost, quill-pusher?"
23. She stares him down. "Just thirsty."
24. She finishes her drink. The problem is clear: Thessen owns the Tribunal.
25. To save Cyran, she has to fight the law with the law.
26. She leaves money on the table.
27. Exits back into the smog.

*Note: The briefing provides the stakes; the bar provides the atmosphere/cameos.*

#### **Emotional Architecture**

**Emotional Beats (5-8 Key Moments):**

1. **Professionalism:** Presenting the report.
2. **Shock:** The Gala revelation.
3. **Disgust:** Thessen's casual commodification of a person.
4. **Helplessness:** She can't stop it yet.
5. **Esape:** The need to be away from the Spine.
6. **Observation:** Watching Cairn/Seraph—a glimpse of other lives.
7. **Resolve:** Alcohol clarifies her anger. She's going to fight.

**Character Arc Moment:**  
Lysa moves from "Auditor" to "Defender"—she decides to use her skills to block Thessen.

**Relationship Dynamics:**  
**Tribunal vs. Lysa:** Alienation complete. She is no longer one of them.

**Subtext Layer:**  
Thessen talks about Cyran like a prize horse. Lysa is the only one in the room who sees a man.
