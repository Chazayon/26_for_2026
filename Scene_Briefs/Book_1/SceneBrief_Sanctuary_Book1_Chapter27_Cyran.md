#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Cyran comes to Lysa's quarters that night. He is frantic, hiding his terror behind intensity. He tells her the hearing was "handled" but refuses to give details. He needs to feel her. He initiates intimacy—not the gentle sleepover of Ch 17, but something fierce and consuming. He is memorizing her. Every touch is a silent goodbye. Lysa senses the desperation but misinterprets it as relief/passion. They make love (Spicy Scene 3). Afterwards, he holds her while she sleeps, counting her breaths, before slipping out into the night to surrender to Varos.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Say goodbye with his body because he can't say it with words.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Profound intimacy followed by abandonment.

**Scene Question:**  
Can he leave her after this? (Answer: Yes, because of this).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
Dawn. He must be at the Temple by sunrise.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *I need to burn this moment into my skin so I can feel it when I'm back in the dark.*
2. *She opens the door, and I almost fall to my knees just seeing her.*
3. *If I speak, I will scream. so I don't speak.*
