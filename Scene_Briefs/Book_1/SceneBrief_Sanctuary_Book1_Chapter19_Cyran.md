#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Fleeing the Archive, they need to know *when* Thessen plans to use the Key. Cyran knows a broker: The Maestro (villain of Book 2, introduced here). They go to the Maestro's club/den. Maestro is creepy, musical, and knows everything. He conducts a symphony of invisible instruments while talking. Cyran asks for Thessen's schedule. Maestro agrees to trade for a future favor (*"A song from your pretty throat one day, Cyran"*). Cyran agrees (reluctantly). Maestro reveals Thessen is moving *tomorrow night* at the Great Pulse. He also hints that Thessen is working for someone bigger (Prime Contract). Lysa hates Maestro instantly.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Get the timeline.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Intel secured. A dangerous debt is incurred to Maestro.

**Scene Question:**  
What is the price of information?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
They have less than 24 hours.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *I'd rather bargain with a demon. Demons have clearer contracts.*
2. *The Maestro conducts silence like it's a weapon.*
3. *His music room smells of rosin and fear.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Enter Maestro's club (back door).

3. Maestro stands in the center, back to them. Conducting.
4. "You're off-key, Cyran," Maestro says without turning.
5. "I'm in a hurry, Maestro."
6. Maestro turns. Masked, elegant, terrifying.
7. "Thessen," Maestro guesses. "He's loud lately."
8. "When?" Cyran asks.
9. "When will he pull your string?" Maestro laughs. "Tomorrow. The Great Pulse."
10. "Why?" Lysa asks.
11. Maestro looks at her. "Ah. The Scribe. He needs a spectacle to bind the investors."
12. "The price?" Cyran asks.
13. "A favor. To be named later."
14. "No," Lysa says. "Cash."
15. "I have enough cash," Maestro smiles. "I want... art."
16. Cyran steps forward. "Done."
17. Lysa grabs his arm. "Cyran."
18. "We need the time," he says to her.
19. "Done," Cyran repeats.
20. Maestro bows. "Tomorrow night. Temple of the Heart. Don't be late."
21. "Oh, and Cyran? The Creditor is watching."
22. Chill runs down Cyran's spine.
23. They leave.
24. "You shouldn't have promised him," Lysa says outside.
25. "I'd promise him my kidneys if it kept you safe," he says.

*Note: Sets up Book 2 conflict elegantly.*
