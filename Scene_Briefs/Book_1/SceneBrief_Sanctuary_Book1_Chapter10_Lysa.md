#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
In the aftermath of the crisis/feeding, neither can pretend this is just professional anymore. Lysa is dizzy, recovering from blood loss; Cyran tends her (role reversal). They're in hiding while they heal—a safe house in the bone-markets. She admits to herself: this is no longer a neutral audit. He's reeling: she wanted him but refused the bribe version of him. They have their first honest conversation: She asks what he actually wants—not for survival, but for himself. He doesn't know. A message arrives from Thessen demanding Cyran's presence for a "ceremony." They agree to work together to protect him.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Recover and plan the next move.  
Cyran: Care for her (guilt).

**Scene Outcome:**  
They form a true alliance. The audit becomes a cover for their real mission: protecting Cyran.

**Scene Question:**  
What are they to each other now?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
Thessen's message implies an immediate summons.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The world is fuzzy at the edges, like a map drawn in charcoal and then smeared.*
2. *He looks at me like I'm breakable, which is annoying, considering I just saved his life.*
3. *There is a spot on my neck that tingles. A phantom pulse.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Lysa wakes on a pile of furs. Light filtering through cracks.
2. She sits up. Dizziness hits. Swaying.
3. Cyran is there instantly. "Easy."
4. He hands her a cup. "Sugar water. It's all they had."
5. She drinks. It helps.
6. She looks at him. He's healed—pale but whole. The wound is gone.
7. "You're okay," she says.
8. "I'm fine. You're pale." He looks guilty.
9. "It was necessary," she says.
10. "It was dangerous." He sits back on his heels. Distance.
11. "Why did you refuse the first time?" he asks suddenly. "In my quarters."
12. "Because you were paying me," she says.
13. "Everyone pays," he says. "That's how it works."
14. "Not with me." She reaches out. Touches his hand.
15. "cyran. What do you *want*? If you didn't have to pay?"
16. He stares at her hand. "I don't know."
17. Silence. The truth of it hangs there.
18. A scraping sound at the door slot. A message cylinder drops in.
19. Cyran flinches. "Thessen."
20. He retrieves it. Reads the scroll.
21. Face hardens. "Ceremony. Tonight."
22. "What kind of ceremony?"
23. "The kind I used to do in the temple."
24. Lysa stands up (too fast, stumbles, he catches her).
25. "No," she says. "We fight this."
26. "How? He owns the Tribunal."
27. "I *am* the Tribunal," she says fiercely. "I'll find a precedent."
28. "We do this together."
29. He looks at her. Really looks at her.
30. "Together," he agrees.
31. He helps her to the door.
32. The partnership is sealed.

*Note: The adhesive moment where they choose each other.*
