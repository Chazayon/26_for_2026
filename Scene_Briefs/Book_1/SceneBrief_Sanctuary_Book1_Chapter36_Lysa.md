#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They limp out of the collapsing Temple ruins through the sub-basement (where it all started). They collapse in a safe alcove to catch their breath. They are covered in dust, blood, and god-ash. The adrenaline crashes. The silence is loud. Lysa tends to Cyran's burns (from the node). He flinches, but lets her. He starts to apologize for leaving her in Ch 28. She stops him. She's still angry, but she understands. *"I thought I was saving you,"* he says. *"You were choosing for me,"* she corrects. *"Don't do it again."* He promises. They share a quiet, exhausted intimacy. Not sex, but survival. They lean against each other as the dust settles.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Establish new ground rules.  
Cyran: Accept forgiveness.

**Scene Outcome:**  
The relationship is repaired, but stronger/different. Equal footing.

**Scene Question:**  
Are we okay? (Answer: We will be).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
None. The danger is passed.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *His hands are shaking. Mine are steady. We make one whole person.*
2. *The silence feels heavy, like a blanket we both need.*
3. *We look like we crawled out of a grave, which is technically true.*
