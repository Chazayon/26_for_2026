#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Cyran is back in the Temple (The Heart of the Titan). He is bound to an altar. Thessen enters, holding the scroll (copy of the record). He reads the Key Phrase: *"Obedience is the only Virtue."* The magic slams into Cyran. His mind screams *NO*, but his body relaxes into perfect stillness. Thessen commands him: *"Stand. Dress for the ceremony. Take the dagger."* Cyran watches himself obey from a distance (locked-in syndrome). He dresses in ceremonial white. He picks up the sacrificial blade. Thessen explains the finale: Cyran will execute the High Priest (a rival) during the ceremony, framing himself and giving Thessen control of the Faith. Cyran can't stop it.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Resist the command.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Failure. Total loss of bodily autonomy.

**Scene Question:**  
Can he break the conditioning? (Not alone).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The drums are beating outside.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *My hand is not my hand. It is a tool, and he is holding the handle.*
2. *I scream, but my mouth smiles.*
3. *The words taste like copper and ash in my mind.*
