#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
The Binding Ritual begins in the Heart-Chamber. Varos chants, and the Heart-Node (a massive, beating crystal/flesh structure suspended above the altar) pulses with corruption. Cyran is chained to the stone. The magic flays his mind, trying to erase "Cyran" and leave only "Relic." He fights it. He remembers the fork he stole (Ch 29) but can't reach it. He starts to fade—the pain is too much. He is ready to give in to the silence. Then he hears a noise. Not a chant. An explosion. And a voice shouting his name. It's Lysa. She didn't leave him. She came for him. The realization snaps him back to clarity. *She is here. I have to live.*

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Resist the erasure until help arrives.

**Scene Outcome:**  
He survives the initial wave of magic. He knows he is not alone.

**Scene Question:**  
Is he worth saving? (Answer: Yes, because she is here).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The Node is descending.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The chanting is trying to unmake me, syllable by syllable.*
2. *I hold onto my name like a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails.*
3. *Pain is honest. This isn't pain; it's emptiness.*

26. "I'm here," he rasps.
27. Varos looks furious. "Seal the doors!"
28. "Too late," Cyran smiles. Blood on his teeth.
