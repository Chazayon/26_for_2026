#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They need to rest before the night mission. The safe house has one mattress (or pile of furs). Unlike the tunnel (Ch 7), this isn't forced by survival—it's chosen. Cyran is anxious, pacing. Lysa invites him to lie down. He hesitates—beds are for *work* or *sleeping alone*. To share a bed for rest is intimate. He lies down. She holds him (big spoon/little spoon dynamics, or just facing each other). They talk softly about what they'd do if they weren't fighting. He realizes he feels safe enough to close his eyes. He sleeps dreamlessly for the first time in years.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Let go of hyper-vigilance.  
Lysa: Anchor him.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Deep emotional bonding. Physical comfort without demand.

**Scene Question:**  
Can Cyran rest?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
Sunset is the deadline to wake up.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *A bed is usually a battlefield or a coffin. She makes it look like a cloud.*
2. *The dust motes dance in the light, and for once, I don't feel the need to count them.*
3. *I am vibrating with the need to run, and she is an anchor of gravity.*

23. He doesn't want to bite. He wants to protect.
24. He moves closer. Their foreheads touch.
25. "If we survive," he whispers, "I'd like to try real wine. Not the bribe kind."

27. His eyes get heavy.
28. The hyper-vigilance unspools.
29. He falls asleep.
