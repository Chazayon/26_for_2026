#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They visit the Bone Wall—the massive archive where Relics are listed as property. Cyran finds his entry. It reads *Subject 9: Relic.* He takes a chisel (symbolic) and strikes the stone. He doesn't erase the past; he adds to it. He carves his name: *CYRAN.* Then he turns to Lysa, who holds the Official Ledger of the City. She strikes the "Property" stamp and writes: *Status: Free Citizen. Protector.* It's a small, private ceremony witnessed only by Cairn (who nods from the shadows). Cyran turns to Lysa and says it finally: *"I love you."* No deflection. Just truth. She says it back. *"I know. I love you too."*

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Officially record his freedom.

**Scene Outcome:**  
He is legally and emotionally free.

**Scene Question:**  
Who defines us? (Answer: We do).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
None.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The wall is cold, but the names burned into it are hot with history.*
2. *He holds the chisel like a weapon, which I suppose it is.*
3. *Ink is powerful. Stone is permanent. Passing laws requires both.*
