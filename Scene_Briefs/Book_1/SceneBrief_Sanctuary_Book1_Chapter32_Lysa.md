#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Lysa blows the door (using Marrow's acid or a generic explosive she improvised). She steps into the Heart-Chamber. It's terrifying—a cathedral of bone with a beating meat-heart suspended in the air. Varos stands over Cyran. Lysa holds up the Scroll of Old Law Solen gave her. She doesn't beg; she commands. *"I challenge this Binding under Section 4, Paragraph 8 of the Founder's Covenant!"* Varos laughs, but the magic *stutters*. The Heart-Node pauses its beating. The Law is woven into the magic. Lysa walks down the aisle, ignoring the guards (who are confused by the magical interruption). She locks eyes with Cyran. *"I'm invalidating the contract,"* she tells him. *"Hold on."*

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Interrupt the ritual using Law.

**Scene Outcome:**  
The ritual is paused. The immediate threat of erasure is halted.

**Scene Question:**  
Can you sue a god? (Answer: Yes, if the god runs on contracts).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The pause is temporary.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The door explodes inward. I always wanted to make an entrance.*
2. *The room smells like a butcher shop inside a cathedral.*
3. *Varos looks at me like I'm a typo he needs to erase.*
