#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Lysa and Cyran stand on a balcony overlooking the city (within the Hollow Titan's ribs). The view is breathtaking and terrifying. The city is still broken—crime, corruption, and the Prime Contract still lurk. But the Heart-Node is gone. The beat of the city is different—less predatory. Lysa reflects on the journey. They haven't fixed the world, but they've carved out a sanctuary. Cyran takes her hand. They look at the "Velvet Marrow" district (Book 2 setting) glowing in the distance. *"Ready for the next one?"* he asks. *"Not tonight,"* she says. *"Tonight, we just breathe."*

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Contextualize the victory.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Book 1 concludes on a hopeful, open note.

**Scene Question:**  
Did we win? (Answer: We survived, and that's winning).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
None.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Cyran's hand is warm. That's the only truth I need.*
2. *From up here, you can't see the blood on the cobblestones.*
3. *The Titan is dead, but the people living in its bones are very much alive.*
