#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They arrive at Thessen's estate—a suspended palace in the Spine. The Gala is decadent: food that bleeds, music that weeps, and the city's elite buying favors. Lysa separates from Cyran (protocol). She mingles, gathering intel. She overhears Lords discussing the "Prime Contract" market—buying shares in souls. She watches Cyran from across the room. He is the center of attention, charming, laughing, drinking. It looks perfect, but she sees the tightness in his jaw. Thessen parades him around. A rival Lord (Lord Vane) touches Cyran too familiarly; Cyran laughs it off, but Lysa grip handles her wine glass until it cracks. She realizes this isn't a party; it's an auction.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Gather evidence of Thessen's illegal dealings.  
Cyran (Observed): Distract the guests.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Lysa confirms the auction nature of the event and identifies the Prime Contract's involvement.

**Scene Question:**  
What specifically is being sold tonight?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The main event (speech/auction) is approaching at midnight.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Cyran enters the room like a detonation... silent, bright, and devastating.*
2. *The chandelier is made of actual crystal, which is how you know Thessen is dangerously rich.*
3. *I hate parties. I especially hate parties where the hors d'oeuvres are sentient.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Arrival: The carriage stops. Footmen open doors.
2. Flash of lights/magic. The entry hall is crowded.
3. Lysa presents her credentials. "Auditor Voss. Observer."
4. The doorman sneers but lets her in.
5. She enters the ballroom. It's massive, suspended over the abyss.
6. The floor is glass—you can see the Ribcage far below.
7. She feels vertigo. Steadies herself.
8. Cyran is swept away by Thessen immediately.
9. Lysa drifts to the edges (Wallflower strategy).
10. She accepts a drink but plants it in a potted fern.
11. Observation: She scans the room. Lords, Magistrates, High Priests.
12. Conversation nearby: "The Prime Contract yields are up 12%."
13. She moves closer, pretending to admire a tapestry.
14. "Soul futures," a Lord says. "Best investment."
15. She makes a mental note. *Economy based on dammnation plans.*
16. She looks for Cyran.
17. He is by the fountain. Surrounded by women and men.
18. He is laughing—head thrown back, throat exposed.
19. It looks genuine. Lysa feels a pang of doubt. *Is he enjoying this?*
20. Then she sees his hand: gripping his own thigh, knuckles white.
21. *No. He's enduring.*
22. Lord Vane approaches Cyran. Hands on his waist.
23. Lysa steps forward instinctively. Stops. *Can't blow cover.*
24. Cyran spins out of the touch—graceful, like a dance move.
25. He catches Lysa's eye across the room.
26. A micro-expression: *Help me.* Or maybe *Don't look.*
27. Thessen claps his hands. "Everyone! To the main hall!"
28. The crowd moves.
29. Lysa follows, slipping her stun-baton into her sleeve.
30. The auction is beginning.

*Note: The tension is visual. She watches him being handled.*

#### **Emotional Architecture**

**Emotional Beats (5-8 Key Moments):**

1. **Awe/Disgust:** The opulence of the enemy.
2. **Isolation:** She is the only "sober" person here.
3. **Jealousy:** Watching others touch him.
4. **Protective Fury:** Seeing Vane grab him.
5. **Validation:** Seeing his hand clinch—he hates it too.
6. **Dread:** The realization of what the auction is.

**Character Arc Moment:**  
Lysa realizes she isn't just auditing a patrolman; she's auditing a slave trade.

**Relationship Dynamics:**  
**Watcher/Watched:** The eye contact moment anchors them. They are communicating without words.

**Subtext Layer:**  
The glass floor symbolizes their precarious position. One crack and they fall.
