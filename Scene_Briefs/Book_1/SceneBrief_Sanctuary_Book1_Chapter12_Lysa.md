#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They arrive at Thessen's estate—a suspended palace in the Spine. The Gala is decadent: food that bleeds, music that weeps, and the city's elite buying favors. Lysa separates from Cyran (protocol). She mingles, gathering intel. She overhears Lords discussing the "Prime Contract" market—buying shares in souls. She watches Cyran from across the room. He is the center of attention, charming, laughing, drinking. It looks perfect, but she sees the tightness in his jaw. Thessen parades him around. A rival Lord (Lord Vane) touches Cyran too familiarly; Cyran laughs it off, but Lysa grip handles her wine glass until it cracks. She realizes this isn't a party; it's an auction.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Gather evidence of Thessen's illegal dealings.  
Cyran (Observed): Distract the guests.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Lysa confirms the auction nature of the event and identifies the Prime Contract's involvement.

**Scene Question:**  
What specifically is being sold tonight?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The main event (speech/auction) is approaching at midnight.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Cyran enters the room like a detonation... silent, bright, and devastating.*
2. *The chandelier is made of actual crystal, which is how you know Thessen is dangerously rich.*
3. *I hate parties. I especially hate parties where the hors d'oeuvres are sentient.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Arrival: The carriage stops. Footmen open doors.
2. Flash of lights/magic. The entry hall is crowded.
3. Lysa presents her credentials. "Auditor Voss. Observer."
4. The doorman sneers but lets her in.
5. She enters the ballroom. It's massive, suspended over the abyss.
6. The floor is glass—you can see the Ribcage far below.
7. She feels vertigo. Steadies herself.
8. Cyran is swept away by Thessen immediately.
9. Lysa drifts to the edges (Wallflower strategy).
10. She accepts a drink but plants it in a potted fern.
11. Observation: She scans the room. Lords, Magistrates, High Priests.
12. Conversation nearby: "The Prime Contract yields are up 12%."
13. She moves closer, pretending to admire a tapestry.
14. "Soul futures," a Lord says. "Best investment."
15. She makes a mental note. *Economy based on dammnation plans.*
16. She looks for Cyran.
17. He is by the fountain. Surrounded by women and men.
18. He is laughing—head thrown back, throat exposed.
19. It looks genuine. Lysa feels a pang of doubt. *Is he enjoying this?*
20. Then she sees his hand: gripping his own thigh, knuckles white.
21. *No. He's enduring.*
22. Lord Vane approaches Cyran. Hands on his waist.
23. Lysa steps forward instinctively. Stops. *Can't blow cover.*
24. Cyran spins out of the touch—graceful, like a dance move.
25. He catches Lysa's eye across the room.
26. A micro-expression: *Help me.* Or maybe *Don't look.*
27. Thessen claps his hands. "Everyone! To the main hall!"
28. The crowd moves.
29. Lysa follows, slipping her stun-baton into her sleeve.
30. The auction is beginning.

*Note: The tension is visual. She watches him being handled.*

#### **Emotional Architecture**

**Emotional Beats (5-8 Key Moments):**

1. **Awe/Disgust:** The opulence of the enemy.
2. **Isolation:** She is the only "sober" person here.
3. **Jealousy:** Watching others touch him.
4. **Protective Fury:** Seeing Vane grab him.
5. **Validation:** Seeing his hand clinch—he hates it too.
6. **Dread:** The realization of what the auction is.

**Character Arc Moment:**  
Lysa realizes she isn't just auditing a patrolman; she's auditing a slave trade.

**Relationship Dynamics:**  
**Watcher/Watched:** The eye contact moment anchors them. They are communicating without words.

**Subtext Layer:**  
The glass floor symbolizes their precarious position. One crack and they fall.

####  **World Interaction & Secondary Characters**

**Secondary Character Interactions:**

- **Lady Morven (Aristocrat/Antagonistic NPC):** High society guest at Thessen's Gala, dripping in jewels made from calcified god-bone, holds a glass of blood-wine like it's a fashion accessory. Approaches Lysa to gossip/probe about why an Auditor is attending.
  - **Distinct voice/mannerism:** Affected aristocratic drawl, uses "darling" and "dreadful" constantly, weaponized politeness, touches Lysa's arm in false intimacy

**Dialogue Moments:**

- **Worldbuilding:** "Thessen's Relic is _exquisite_, isn't he? They say he killed three men last month with just his bare hands. So dreadful. So _thrilling_." Reveals how the aristocracy fetishizes Relics as dangerous pets/art pieces
- **Local gossip:** "Of course, everyone knows Thessen keeps the creature on a _very_ short leash these days. Ever since that incident with the Ambassador's daughter..." (implies scandal, Cyran's past violence)
- **Speech pattern:** Breathy, scandalized tone, euphemisms for violence ("incident," "unpleasantness"), treats murder as gossip fodder

**Character Interaction Beats:**

- **How Lysa treats Lady Morven:** Forces a polite smile, responds with minimal bureaucratic pleasantries ("How fascinating, my lady"), mentally cataloguing the conversation as evidence of systemic dehumanization. Internal rage vs. external composure.
- **What it reveals:** Lysa is an excellent actress when needed (undercover skills), but she's disgusted by this world. The interaction shows the moral rot at the top of society.
- **The moment:** When Morven says "You simply _must_ ask Thessen for a private demonstration," Lysa's smile turns into something sharp: "I prefer my demonstrations to involve paperwork, my lady." Polite resistance.

**Environmental Engagement:**

- **Background activity:** Orchestra playing (identifiable as a specific piece from the Series Bible's culture section), servants in bone-white livery circulating with trays, other guests pointing at Cyran on display, someone laughing too loud near the fountain
- **Objects noticed:** The blood-wine in crystal goblets (Lysa notices it's real blood, not dyed), elaborate centerpiece made of preserved god-spawn wings, the ballroom's chandelier (described as "ossuaries lit from within")
- **Physical interaction:** Lysa accepts a glass of wine she won't drink (holding it gives her something to do with her hands), adjusts her formal robes when they catch on her boot, sidesteps a drunk aristocrat stumbling past

**Purpose:**
Lady Morven embodies the "casual cruelty of the ruling class" and prevents this from being just Lysa watching Cyran from afar. The dialogue does critical work: it shows how Cyran is discussed by his "owners'" social circle (as a thing, a pet, a spectacle), gives Lysa someone to verbally spar with (showing her restraint and quick thinking), and provides worldbuilding about god-bone jewelry, blood-wine culture, and past scandals. The environmental details paint the Gala as grotesque excess built on suffering, making Lysa's (and the reader's) discomfort visceral.
