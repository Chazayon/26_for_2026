#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They reach the safe house again. The adrenaline crashes. Cyran is frantic to get the makeup and the outfit *off*. He tears at the clothes, scrubbing his skin raw to remove the gold dust. It's a trauma response—he feels contaminated. Lysa stops him before he hurts himself. She helps him clean up gently (wet cloth, slow movements). In the quiet grimness, he confesses: *"I wasn't a warrior in the Temple. I was an ornament. I learned to fight so I wouldn't have to be pretty anymore."* He explains the "Blood Relic" title is a lie; he's a temple-prostitute turned killer. He expects her to be disgusted. She kisses his forehead (non-sexual, benediction). *"You are not what they made you."*

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Cleanse himself of the Gala.  
Lysa: Comfort him.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Full emotional disclosure. The lies are gone.

**Scene Question:**  
Will she accept the truth of his past?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
None. The world has stopped for them.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *She watches me unravel. I am not graceful when I break.*
2. *The gold won't come off. It's in the pores. It's in the blood.*
3. *I need to tear this skin off and find the one underneath.*
