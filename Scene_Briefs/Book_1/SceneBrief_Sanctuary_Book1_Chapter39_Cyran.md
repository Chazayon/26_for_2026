#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
They go to Cairn's Bar to celebrate. It's lively. Cyran is no longer hiding in the shadows; he sits at the bar with Lysa. Cairn pours free drinks. On stage, **Seraph** (Angel Dust archetype) is performing—singing a haunting song. Seraph looks tired, trapped (glancing at a Maestro-sigil on his collar). Cyran notices. During a break, Cyran approaches Seraph. Seraph flirts reflexively. Cyran gently shuts it down. *"I'm taken."* He leans in. *"The cage has a lock. But locks can be picked. Hang on."* Seraph looks at him with sudden, sharp hope. Cyran returns to Lysa. He knows there are others to save, but for tonight, he is just a man with a drink and a partner.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Enjoy freedom and pass the spark to Seraph.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Book 2 is set up. Cyran's character growth (helper) is confirmed.

**Scene Question:**  
Who is next?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
None.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The whiskey tastes cheap and burns like heaven.*
2. *I used to watch this room from the rafters. The view is better from a stool.*
3. *The singer has a voice like spun sugar glass—beautiful and ready to cut you.*
