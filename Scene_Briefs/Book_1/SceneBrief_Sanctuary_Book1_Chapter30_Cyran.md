#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
That night, Cyran sends Lysa to bed (safe house). He stays up, looking at the fragment of Thessen's ledger. He feels a pull—the same blood-whisper from Chapter 1. He traces the sigil of the Nameless Creditor. Suddenly, reality bends. He is in a vision (Mindscape). The Prime Contract speaks to him—not a voice, but a pressure. *"You broke the tool, but the debt is transferred."* Cyran realizes killing Thessen didn't free him; it just upgraded his enemy. The Creditor marks him (a new scar/sigil appears on his chest). He wakes up gasping. Lysa rushes in. He shows her the mark. "We have a problem."

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Understand the threat.

**Scene Outcome:**  
The stakes are raised to the cosmic level.

**Scene Question:**  
What did we wake up?

N/A.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Victory should taste like wine. This tastes like copper.*
