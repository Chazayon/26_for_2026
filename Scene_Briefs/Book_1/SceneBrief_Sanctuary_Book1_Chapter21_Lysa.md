#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Lysa wakes in a cell in the Vein Prison (underground). She is stripped of her rank but not her wits. She is interrogated by a junior guard, whom she intimidates with legal gibberish. Left alone, she examines her cell. She realizes the wall connects to the old medical ward. Through a grate, she meets **Dr. Marrow** (Book 3 Lead), who is nominally working there but seems bored/amused by her predicament. Marrow offers her a tool (a bone-saw or chemical) in exchange for "interesting data" about the sonic weapons Voss used. Lysa trades the intel. Marrow gives her an acid vial. She uses it to melt the lock. She escapes the cell, knowing she has to get to the Temple before nightfall.

**Scene Goal:**  
Lysa: Escape the prison.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Lysa is free, armed, and moving toward the climax.

**Scene Question:**  
How does a scribe break out of jail? (Answer: With chemistry and a sociopath's help).

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The Ceremony is at sunset.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *The cell smells of mildew and despair, which are technically two different scents.*
2. *Voss took my badge, but he forgot to check for the hair-pin. Amateur.*
3. *A voice floats through the wall, smooth as velvet and sharp as a scalpel.*

7. "Someone conducting research," the voice says.
8. She peers through. Sees a pristine white coat in a dirty room.
9. "Dr. Marrow?" she guesses (from reports).
10. "And you are the Auditor who blew up the Gala. Fascinating."
11. "I need out," she says.
12. "I'm sure you do. Why should I help?"
13. "Because Voss is using unregistered sonic tech. I saw the schematics."
14. Pause. "Sonic tech? How crude. Tell me frequency."
15. She recites the numbers (photographic memory).
16. "Acceptable," Marrow says.
17. A glass vial slides through the grate.
18. "Corrosive. Don't get it on your fingers."
19. "Thank you."
20. "Don't die. You're interesting."
21. Lysa takes the vial to the lock.
22. Pours it. hissing smoke.
23. The metal liquefies.
24. She pushes the door. It creaks open.
25. She slips into the corridor.
26. Knocks out a guard with a rock (improvised).
27. Takes his keys and weapon.
28. Runs for the surface.

*Note: Marrow is neutral-evil here, helpful only for knowledge.*
