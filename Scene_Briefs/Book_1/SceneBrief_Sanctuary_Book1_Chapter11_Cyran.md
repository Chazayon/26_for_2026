#### **Plot & Structure**

**Plot Summary:**  
Cyran prepares for the Donor Gala. He is in his quarters, but Thessen has sent a "stylist" (a flesh-sculptor) to ensure he looks perfect. The process is invasive and humiliating. Cyran dissociates, slipping into his "Ornament" persona—vapid, pliant, beautiful. He dresses in the outfit provided: sheer, restrictive, designed to showcase him as property. He looks in the mirror and doesn't recognize himself; he sees a very expensive object. He hides a small blade in his boot—a tiny rebellion. Lysa arrives to escort him (part of the plan), and her reaction to his appearance cracks his mask briefly.

**Scene Goal:**  
Cyran: Survive the prep without breaking character.  
Lysa (Arrival): retrieve him for the mission.

**Scene Outcome:**  
Cyran is "perfected" for the event. Lysa sees the extent of his commodification.

**Scene Question:**  
How much of Cyran is left under the paint?

**Ticking Clock/Deadline:**  
The carriage is waiting. Thessen waits for no one.

**Opening Hook - First Line Strategy:**

1. *Gold dust on the collarbones. Kohl on the eyes. A collar on the soul.*
2. *The stylist has hands like cold spiders, and she hums while she pins me into the silk.*
3. *I am not a person tonight. I am a centerpiece.*

#### **Action Beats (25 Minimum)**

1. Cyran stands on a podium. Passive.
2. The stylist (Mistress Vhane) circles him. "Chin up. Higher."
3. She applies a shimmering powder to his chest. He holds his breath.
4. "You've been eating well," she notes. "Skin is flush."
5. He thinks of Lysa's blood. Says nothing. "I aim to please."
6. She tightens the corset-like vest. It restricts breathing.
7. "Lord Thessen wants you... accessible," she says, adjusting a transparent panel.
8. Cyran smiles—the empty smile. "Of course. Accessibility is my specialty."
9. She finishes. "Look."
10. He turns to the mirror.
11. The reflection is stunning. And horrifying.
12. He looks like a prize stallion. Expensive, leashed, ready for auction.
13. "Perfect," Vhane says. She packs her kit and leaves.
14. Alone. Cyran exhales (difficult in the vest).
15. He reaches for his boot. Slides a thin, glass dagger into the lining.
16. "Just in case," he whispers.
17. A knock. "Cyran?" Lysa's voice.
18. He freezes. Puts the mask back on. "Enter."
19. Lysa enters. She's wearing severe formal robes—a shield of fabric.
20. She stops when she sees him.
21. Her eyes widen. Not lust—anger.
22. "What did they do to you?" she breathes.
23. He twirls. "Do you like it? It's the latest fashion in 'High-End Martyr'."
24. She walks to him. Reaches out, stops before touching the sheer silk.
25. "You look..."
26. "Expensive?" he supplies.
27. "Like a target," she finishes.
28. "That's the point, darling." He offers his arm.
29. "Shall we? The wolves are hungry."
30. She takes his arm. Her grip is tight. Anchoring.
31. "I'm with you," she whispers.
32. "I know," he thinks. " That's why I'm afraid."
33. They exit.

*Note: The contrast between Vhane's touch (ownership) and Lysa's touch (solidarity).*

#### **Emotional Architecture**

**Emotional Beats (5-8 Key Moments):**

1. **Dissociation:** Enduring the touch of the stylist.
2. **Shame:** Seeing himself as an object in the mirror.
3. **Rebellion:** Hiding the knife.
4. **Fear:** Lysa seeing him like this.
5. **Surprise:** She's not turned on; she's furious for him.
6. **Gratitude:** Her anger validates his humanity.
7. **Performance:** Putting on the "Ornament" face to protect them both.

**Character Arc Moment:**  
Cyran arms himself (the knife), showing he intends to fight back this time, unlike the past.

**Relationship Dynamics:**  
**Protector/Protected:** Lysa hates seeing him vulnerable. He hates being seen.

**Subtext Layer:**
