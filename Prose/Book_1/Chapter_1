I stand on a rib. Not a metaphorical one, though the city does love those. A real, arched fragment of god-bone, curving over the street like the broken cage of some titanic chest, slick with condensation and the greasy sheen of marrow vapor. The wind—what little of it can be bothered to stir at this hour—slides over my face, cool and damp, bringing with it the distant echo of market bells, the murmur of sleepless sinners, and underneath it all, that low, constant creak of settling bones that means the Reliquary hasn’t yet decided to collapse in on itself and end our collective misery.

My boots are already ruined.

I tip my weight forward on the balls of my feet, leather armor creaking softly, and peer down into the fog-choked artery of the street below. Lamps burn low, swallowed in the marrow-haze so that everything glows faintly red and green, as if the city is holding its breath beneath stained glass. Somewhere out there in the murk, a feral god-spawn is chewing its way through the late-night population like a child loose in a confectioner’s.

My goal is elegant in its simplicity: find the beast, kill it before it kills anyone else, and make sure the right people notice so they carve a few more Merit Marks into my ledger instead of my hide. Freedom by inches, paid in blood and performance.

If I were a better monster, I wouldn’t enjoy this part so much.

A shriek knifes through the night—high, human, and far enough away that if I misjudge the distance, I’ll be peeling what’s left of them off the cobbles later. My jaw tightens before my thoughts catch up, body already shifting, weight gathering. The sound ricochets around the ribcage arches, but there’s a clarity to terror if you know how to listen.

Left. Two streets down, one level lower. Near the cistern access. Of course.

“Lazy thing,” I murmur to no one, straightening the line of my cuff where a scuff of grime mars the black leather. “Couldn’t have picked somewhere with better lighting?”​

The shriek cuts off.

That’s the clock starting.

I step off the rib.

For one suspended heartbeat there’s only air, damp and cold against my face, my coat flaring behind me like a curtain at the close of a show. Then my boots kiss bone again as I land on the sloped roof of a calcified townhouse, knees bending to take the force, fingers brushing stone for balance. Not a sound, not even the clatter of loosened grit. The Vigil likes its Relics graceful. Showy. If we must be monsters, we are at least expensive ones.

The mist licks at my cheeks as I run, low and fast along the roofline, shadows slipping past shadows. Rot rides the air first—a sweet-sour stench of old garbage and meat left too long at the altars. Then ozone, sharp and wrong, like lightning trapped in a jar. And underneath that, the bright, thin tang of fresh fear-sweat.​

Ah. There you are.

I angle my path toward it, boots finding the familiar rhythm of patrol along the ribcage’s spine: leap, land, slide, push off another spur of bone. Below, the street curls between towering arcs of rib, their inner curves strung with bioluminescent moss that throbs a dull, exhausted green. The light paints everyone who passes beneath it in the same sickly hue, no matter their sins. Convenient.

As I vault a narrow gap between structures—a vertebra-bridge, worn smooth by centuries of carts—my gaze snags on a shrine carved into the crook of a rib. The dead god’s face is stylized, all hollow eyes and bleeding sigils, mouth open in an eternal, silent command. Someone’s tucked a wilted bouquet of vein-flowers into its jaw, their petals bruised to black.​

I land beside it and, on impulse, lift two fingers to my lips, then tap the statue’s stone cheek in a parody of piety. “Don’t wait up,” I whisper. “I’ll tuck your wayward children in.”​

The mist shifts. A shape—too many limbs, too much joint where there should be smooth curve—skitters along the wall below and vanishes into the yawning circle of a cistern hatch.​

Of course it goes underground. They always do.

My lips curl in something that isn’t quite a smile. “Filthy, ravenous, and no sense of aesthetics,” I sigh. “We can’t all be perfect.”

I drop.

The hatch rim is slick with grease and something that shines too darkly to be normal water. My gloved fingers bite into bone as I swing down, then release, letting myself slide feet-first into the tunnel. The world narrows to wet stone scraping my shoulders and the rush of air past my ears, the chute angling sharply until gravity does most of the work. The temperature rises by slow degrees, cold damp giving way to a cloying, humid warmth that settles under my armor like another skin.

The smell hits me halfway down.

Not the thin, bright ribbon of mortal blood—though that’s here too, smeared along the wall as if someone’s hand dragged in passing—but the thicker, older scent that lives down in the bones of this place. Iron and salt and something electric that buzzes against my tongue when I breathe through my mouth.

God-blood.

What’s left of the Hollow Titan’s heart congealed in cisterns and pools beneath the district, still pulsing on some ancient, stubborn rhythm that has nothing to do with living bodies. The cisterns are supposed to be sealed, monitored, taxed in whispers and fumes by the Contract Lords. They tithe power like everything else in this city—every prayer, every execution, every intimate little signature meant to feed the Prime Contract sleeping under our laws.​

I’m not meant to be here unsupervised.

I bare my teeth at the dark. “Good thing I’m not real people, then.”

The chute spits me out onto a slick stone ledge, boots skidding, arms briefly pinwheeling. I catch myself on a pillar, fingers digging into ancient chisel marks, and push upright. The chamber opens around me, vast and echoing. The ceiling disappears into shadow; the floor is more suggestion than certainty, broken by great, circular pools where the Titan’s blood has collected in slow, viscous lakes.

They glow. Faintly, but enough—a sullen, dark red that throbs in time with a heartbeat I can feel in the backs of my teeth.

I swallow. My own hunger stirs, lazy and interested, stretching like a cat before deciding whether the prey is worth the effort. The Thirst is never gone; it’s simply polite enough most nights to stay in the corner of the room, pretending it isn’t watching me.

Tonight, it leans forward.

“Well,” I say, voice sounding a touch too bright even to my own ears. “Isn’t this festive.”

My hands know what to do while the rest of me prevaricates. They move to my thighs, fingers unbuckling the straps that hold my daggers in place. Bone hilts—polished smooth with use, carved with inlaid sigils that lick cold against my palms when I draw them free. Twin blades, perfectly balanced, edges catching the bloodlight in clean, pale arcs. I spin them once, more for the feel than the spectacle; even alone, I prefer to give myself a show worth watching.

Somewhere in the dark ahead, something splashes. A heavy, deliberate sound, like a boulder dropped into syrup.​

I smile. “Darling,” I call out, letting a low, familiar melody curl under the word—an aria from a tragic little opera about doomed love and worse contracts. “If you wanted a midnight swim, you should have filed the appropriate notices.”

The response is a scrape of chitin on stone and a hiss that sets the tiny hairs along my arms on end.​

Excellent.

I move forward, steps light and unhurried, keeping to the raised ledges that trace the chamber’s edge in broken, jagged lines. The air hums the closer I get to the nearest pool, the god-blood’s pulse syncing with my own until it’s difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. My tongue presses against the back of my teeth; I can taste it without drinking, like vapor settling on the roof of my mouth—copper, smoke, and the kind of old, buried power that makes the world lean ever so slightly toward it.

There’s a whisper in it. Not words, not yet, just the suggestion of them. As if, if I tilted my head just so, I might catch my name spoken from beneath the surface.

I don’t tilt my head.

Movement. To my right, near the base of a cracked pillar, something unfolds from the shadow.​

The god-spawn crawls into the rim of bloodlight on too many legs, each joint bending the wrong way, carapace slick with the cistern’s condensation. Its body is a mess of bone plates and raw flesh, half-finished by whatever instinctive divinity spat it into existence. A jaw tries to be two jaws at once and fails, opening in a sideways yawn that drips saliva and the wet remnants of whatever it killed before the screaming stopped.​

Sulfur scorches the air around it. The smell of hellfire and bad decisions.​

I exhale, slow and delighted despite myself. “Oh, you are hideous. I love what you’ve done with your limbs.”

It lunges.

One moment it’s coiled in its little pocket of shadow, the next it’s all motion and claw and teeth, hitting the stone where my chest had been a heartbeat before. I’m already moving—backward, pivoting off the ball of my foot, weight rolling through my hips, shoulder dropping just enough that the nearest limb passes by in a rush of air. The impact shudders the ledge, cracks spiderwebbing out from the point of contact.​

Dust rains down from the ceiling in thin, chalky veils.​

“Too slow,” I murmur, and let my left-hand dagger kiss across the thing’s flank as I slip past it.​

The blade parts flesh with a soft, almost affectionate resistance that vibrates up my arm. Black ichor spills, thick and reeking, hissing where it spatters onto the god-blood below. The monster shrieks—a sound like boiling kettles and metal scraped over glass—and whirls, legs scrabbling for purchase on the slick stone.​

This is the part I enjoy. The dance.

I keep moving, never in a straight line, using the columns and pump mechanisms as cover and springboard both. One hand trails along a pillar as I spin around it, leveraging the momentum to duck under another swipe; my boot skims the lip of a smaller pool, sending up a fan of blood that paints the air red between us. I laugh—because why not, no one’s here to complain—and the sound echoes weirdly in the chamber, coming back to me warped and thin.​

“You really should file a grievance,” I say, as those too-many legs skid and the beast nearly pitches headfirst into the nearest cistern. “The Vigil’s acquisition policies are murder.”​

It doesn’t understand, of course. It only knows hunger and pain and the sudden awareness that the pale thing with the pretty knives is more dangerous than it thought. It comes for me anyway.​

Claws rake across my chest, catching leather. I twist, but not quite fast enough; one hooked tip scores a hot line along my cheek.​

Pain blooms bright and sharp, surprising in its immediacy. My teeth snap together, and I bite my own tongue.

Blood floods my mouth—mine, not god’s—and for an instant the world narrows to that taste. Copper, familiar and intimate. The Thirst surges up, sudden and vicious, claws scraping the inside of my ribs as it tries to ride the spike of adrenaline straight into frenzy.

No.

I force air into my lungs, force my shoulders down from their reflexive hunch. Let the pain exist without giving it anything else. The cut is shallow; I can already feel the skin knitting under the trickle, my body mending itself with quiet, ruthless efficiency.​

“Rude,” I tell the beast, voice lower now, humor smoothing into something colder.

It hisses and barrels forward, claws gouging grooves in the stone.​

I meet it.

No more sidesteps. No more teasing, no more pretty little feints to reassure myself I’m in control. My feet strike the ground in a staccato rhythm, every placement chosen with a choreographer’s care: here, where the slick is thinnest; there, where the pillar gives me something to push off. The world sharpens around the point of my right-hand dagger as I bring it up and in, sliding between two plates of jagged bone to sink into the softer mess beneath.​

The creature rears, shrieking, trying to shake me loose. I go with the motion, letting it lift me, boots leaving the stone, my body pivoting along the axis of embedded bone as if we’ve rehearsed this. My free hand catches the ridge of its spine, fingers digging in, finding purchase on the rough, wet cartilage.

“Shh,” I murmur against the spray of its breath, the stink of it making my eyes water. “You’re drawing the wrong kind of attention.”

It bucks. I use the momentum, hauling myself up and over, sliding along the ridge of its back. For a heartbeat I’m straddling the spine of a fallen god’s unfortunate child above a lake of its progenitor’s blood, every wrong decision in my life crystallized into this exact, ridiculous tableau.

Then I drive both daggers down into the clustered knot at the base of its neck.​

The resistance is immense—a dense mass of gristle and bone and whatever passes for nervous system in these scraps of divine refuse. My arms strain, muscles burning, shoulders locking as I put my full weight behind the thrust. Something gives with a wet, crunchy pop. A flare of black sparks erupts along the creature’s limbs as its stolen animus fizzles.​

It collapses.

We hit the stone together, its bulk slamming the breath out of me, legs twitching in dying spasms. My head cracks against the ground; lights burst behind my eyes, brief and starry. For a moment I simply lie there, listening to the echo of its death-rattle shudder through the cavern, mingling with the deeper, steady thrum of the god-blood.

Silence seeps back in, slow and claiming. Drip. Drip. The soft lap of thick liquid against stone. The scratch of my own breathing.

I push myself upright, ichor-slick hands sliding on plated bone until I find leverage. Every movement pulls at some bruise I haven’t had time to catalogue yet. My armor is spattered in black and red; the cut on my cheek has already sealed, leaving only the faintest warmth.​

“Messy,” I tell the corpse, wiping a smear of slime from my sleeve with a careful flick. “I should charge you for the cleaning.”

Something shifts in the corner of my vision. Not the aftermath twitch of dead limbs—smaller, tighter. Huddled.

I go very still.

There, tucked into the shadow between a rusted pump mechanism and the curve of the wall, a shape crouches. Knees drawn up, arms wrapped around them. Wide eyes reflecting what scraps of light manage to reach this far.​

A child.

Of course there’s a child. The city never misses an opportunity to improve its tragedies.

We look at each other across the distance and the carcass of the thing that would have eaten them. For one, absurd instant I think, irrationally, that perhaps they’re not afraid. That perhaps the story their terrified brain will tell itself is simple: monster, savior, grateful tears, a lifetime of fond whispers about the Vigil’s pale hound who pulled them from the jaws of death.

Then they flinch as my eyes meet theirs. Their fingers claw deeper into their own sleeves, trying to fold themselves into nothingness.

Ah. There it is.

Not just fear, but the sharp, particular horror reserved for things that wear a man’s shape and move like something else entirely. For creatures whose eyes catch the bloodlight like a cat’s, whose teeth, when they smile, do not quite stop where human teeth should.

The echo of the kill is still singing in my bones. The god-blood’s hum threads through it, an undercurrent that whispers mine in a voice older than language. The Thirst prowls restlessly, annoyed at being denied playtime, pressing its tongue along my nerves.

I smooth down the front of my coat, as if that might make any of this less terrible, and step around the corpse. I make a point of sheathing one dagger, then the other, motions slow and telegraphed. I leave my hands visible, spread slightly away from my sides.​

“Apologies,” I say lightly. “I don’t usually have an audience. I’d have worn something less… covered in intestines.”

The joke falls flat between us, hanging in the humid air like smoke. The child doesn’t answer. Their breathing comes in sharp little gasps, each one a scrape of sound.

I sink into a shallow bow, one hand to my chest, as if greeting a patron at some infernal salon. It’s easier to lean on the performance than to acknowledge the twist in my gut.​

“Cyran,” I tell them. “Vigil Relic, at your horrific service.”​

Their lips tremble. “You’re—” The word mangles itself against their teeth, comes out strangled. “You’re like it.” Their gaze flicks to the dead thing at my feet. “But… but worse.”

Every Merit Mark I’ve ever earned suddenly feels etched on the wrong side of my skin.

I keep my expression pleasantly blank. Inside, something small and familiar curls tighter. “I assure you, love, I have much better manners.”

They shake their head, eyes huge.

Right. We’re not doing reassurance tonight. We’re doing damage control. I can work with that.

“You shouldn’t be here,” I say, letting the humor drain just enough that my voice sounds more like an order than a tease. “Not in the Ribcage at this hour, and certainly not in a blood cistern with unlicensed fauna.”

Their chin jerks, a tiny involuntary nod.

“Can you walk?”

Another nod, more decisive.

“Good. There’s a patrol stair about twenty paces that way.” I gesture, careful to keep my movements small. “It comes out by the lower tooth-market. Find the nearest Vigil post, tell them Relic Cyran cleared the cistern, and that if they so much as _look_ like they’re going to fine your parents, I will personally rearrange their internal architecture.”​

That earns me the barest flicker of confusion in their expression. Maybe even the ghost of something that might, on a less cursed night, grow into a laugh.

“Go on,” I add, softer. “Up. Home. Preferably somewhere with fewer opportunities to die horribly.”

They uncurl by degrees, every movement cautious, as if I might lunge the moment they expose their throat. Sensible of them, really. They edge past me along the wall, keeping as much stone between us as possible. When they reach the stair, they hesitate, glancing back.​

Their gaze snags on my arms, where the edges of my bracers have ridden up in the scuffle. For a moment, the carved sigils along my forearms are visible—sharp, white-inlaid lines that glow faintly in recognition of the fresh kill nearby. Merit Mark tallies, declarations that I am a good monster, see, I kill the right things.

The child shivers. Then they bolt up the stairs, bare feet slapping stone, until the sound of them is swallowed by distance.

I stand alone again with the corpse and the blood.

The chamber feels bigger without that small, fragile presence in it. Emptier, somehow, for all that I know there are a dozen other hunters and scavengers and bureaucrats crawling through other parts of the titan’s body tonight.​

“Well,” I say into the quiet. “That went poorly.”

The dead god’s blood thrums beneath my feet, every pulse a reminder of what made me. Once, I was an ornament in a temple built into this same rotting heart, a beautiful thing left too long near the wrong ritual. They poured divinity into me until my veins forgot whose name they’d carried first.​

Now I pour it back out, one kill at a time, onto the Tribunal’s ledgers.​

The monster at my feet is already cooling. I kneel beside it, daggers whispering free again, and set to work carving out the part that matters to the men who own me. Every Vigil-sanctioned god-spawn bears a sigil somewhere in its flesh, branded at birth when the Prime Contract’s power flares briefly to acknowledge another debt. Find the sigil, present it, earn your Mark. Simple enough.

Here it is, tucked under overlapping plates near what passes for its chest—a knot of raised flesh marked with a circle of interlocking lines. I slice carefully around it, minimizing the mess more out of habit than respect, and peel the patch of skin free.

It steams in the cool air, the sigil glowing faintly, resonating with the lines on my own arms. For a heartbeat, just one, I let myself imagine what it would be like if these marks meant what they claim. Redemption earned. Personhood restored. A life not tallied in kills and quotas and the whims of men who think god-blood gives them the right to own anything that crawls too close.

Then the blood throbs again. Louder.

The pool nearest me ripples, though nothing disturbs its surface. The whisper I didn’t quite hear before sharpens, coalesces. Sound without source. Words spoken in the language of old contracts and older hunger.
Cyran.

It’s not a voice, not exactly. More like the memory of being named for the first time, dragged up from some deep, black place beneath my consciousness. It brushes against the inside of my thoughts with a lover’s familiarity, the way High Priest Varos once pressed his hand to my chest and told me I was blessed to serve.​

My fingers tighten around the strip of marked flesh until my knuckles ache.

“Not tonight,” I say, the words scraping out harsher than I intend. “You’ve eaten enough.”

The pulse doesn’t stop, but the pressure eases, the sense of attention sliding away. As if whatever lurks in the contract-bound depths of this corpse has decided I am, for now, a negligible asset.​

I tuck the sigil into the pouch at my belt, where it glows faintly through the leather, and push to my feet. My muscles protest, a slow, spreading ache that promises I’ll feel this hunt in my bones come sun-up. If I’m awake to care.

There’ll be paperwork, of course. There’s always paperwork. Some poor ink-stained soul up in the Spine District will have to log this: one unauthorized cistern incursion, one neutralized threat, one Relic operating just close enough to the edge of protocol to make their superiors nervous. The Vigil audit’s in a week; I should probably start pretending to behave.

I picture the scribe they’ll send to evaluate me. Neat handwriting, no sense of humor, eyes like knives behind little spectacles. Someone who believes in redemption as something other than a carrot dangled over a very long drop.​

Someone who will look at me and see exactly what that child saw.

“Lucky them,” I mutter, and turn toward the patrol stair.

The climb up is longer than the slide down, and less fun by half. My boots leave faint, dark prints on the steps where blood and ichor have soaked into the leather. Ruined. I’ll have to bully Cairn into finding me a new pair in the Vein Markets—he’s good at that, turning other people’s losses into my gains. Maybe he’ll even pour me something drinkable when I stop by his bar, something strong enough to smear the edge off the god-blood’s echo humming in my skull.​

By the time I reach the hatch, the marrow-mist has thickened again, curling into the mouth of the stair like it’s curious about what I’ve been doing below its feet. I step out into it and let it swallow me, the Ribcage’s towering arches rising around me like the bars of some colossal, inverted cage.

Somewhere above, the Tribunal’s lights burn in the Spine, cold and bright and watchful. Somewhere below, the dead god’s heart keeps pulsing, patient as debt.​

I roll my shoulders, feeling the dried blood crack along the seams of my armor, and set off into the mist toward the distant glow of the Vein Markets. Another hunt done, another mark earned, another inch on a chain that still circles my throat, no matter how pretty the sigils look on my skin.

Let them come with their ledgers and their questions and their careful, clinical pity. Let them measure out my worth in kills and clauses. Tonight, the city’s bones remember my name, and the worst part is how much I like the sound.​
