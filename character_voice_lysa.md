## VOICE PATTERNS

### Register

### Signature Phrases

No patience for evasion; asks what matters.
- *"Are you this charming with everyone, or just the people auditing you?"*

**Restrained Emotion (Gets Quieter When Angry)**

- *"I will write exactly what happened. If that makes you uncomfortable, good."* (soft, deadly)
- *"No."* (single word, no explanation needed)

**Consent-First Language**

### Voice Checklist (Use Before Writing Every Lysa Line)

**Ask yourself**:
1. ✅ Is she cutting through performance to reach truth?
2. ✅ Does she name the thing no one else will say?
3. ✅ Is her anger quiet and precise (not loud)?
4. ✅ Is she establishing or respecting a boundary?
5. ✅ Would she say this to his face without shame?
6. ✅ Is she being honest, even if it hurts?

**Red flags** (avoid these):
- ❌ Accepting manipulation without calling it out
- ❌ Yelling or losing composure (she gets quieter, not louder)
- ❌ Vague moral platitudes (she's specific about right and wrong)
- ❌ Letting him deflect without gently pressing back

## EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

### Surface Wants
- To complete her audit fairly and accurately
- To reform the Redemption system from within
- To keep her job while maintaining her ethics

### Deep Wants
- Justice within a corrupt system
- To protect the vulnerable without becoming numb to suffering
- To believe redemption is genuinely possible (not performative)
- To be seen as more than a bureaucratic function

### Fears
- Becoming complicit through inaction or compromise
- Losing her moral clarity in a system designed to erode it
- That she'll rubber-stamp the wrong verdict and someone will die
- Caring about Cyran in a way that compromises her judgment
- Being loved only because she holds power over someone's fate

### Core Belief
**"Redemption is possible, but not automatic—and not owed."**

This drives her insistence on real accountability, not performative gestures. She won't give Cyran mercy just because she's attracted to him—he has to earn it through genuine change.

### Emotional Triggers

**Immediate Protective Response**:
- Witnessing exploitation disguised as duty
- Someone using "the rules" to justify cruelty
- Vulnerable people being used as pawns
- Authority figures abusing their power

**Defensive Anger (Quiet Steel)**:
- Being manipulated or lied to (respects honesty, even brutal honesty)
- Seeing someone give up on themselves
- Institutional corruption masquerading as justice

**Genuine Vulnerability Breaks Through When**:
- She admits she wants Cyran (not just as an audit subject)
- She risks her career for what's right
- She confesses fear that she's failing to protect people

---

## PHYSICAL PRESENCE

### Body Language

**Habitual Movements**:
- Stands with spine straight, shoulders back (professional posture)
- Clutches books/scrolls when nervous
- Direct eye contact, doesn't look away first
- Writes notes constantly (coping mechanism and job requirement)
- Steps into others' space when making a point (fearless proximity)

**Power Dynamics**:
- Authority: uses stillness, doesn't need to raise her voice
- Uncertain: fidgets with quill, ink-stained fingers
- Attracted: leans forward before catching herself
- Protective: physically places herself between threat and victim

### Physicality in Dialogue
- Crosses arms when setting boundaries
- Points with her quill when making an argument
- Touches her Tribunal mark (wrist tattoo) when conflicted about duty vs. morality
- Removes reading glasses to make eye contact in serious moments

### Touch Patterns

**Early Book**:
- Minimal touch, professional only
- Flinches slightly at unexpected contact
- Keeps physical distance as part of investigative ethics

**Mid-Book**:
- Tending wounds (practical care that becomes intimate)
- Hand on his arm when grounding him from panic
- Allows him to feed (consent-negotiated, boundary-rich intimacy)

**Late Book**:
- Initiates affection openly
- Rests her hand on his without agenda
- Comfortable with casual closeness

### Fight-or-Flight Tells

**When Angry but Controlled**:
- Voice drops in volume and rises in precision
- Hands very still, deliberate movements
- Jaw tightens
- Writes faster, harder (quill scratching parchment)

**When Scared but Hiding It**:
- Over-formal language
- Clutches her books/documents
- Rapid blinking
- Talks more than usual (filling silence)

## CORE WOUNDS & HEALING ARC

### Wound
Watching the system she believed in become corrupted. Fear that she's complicit by working within it. Doubt that she can make real change.

### Lie She Believes
"If I can't fix the system, I'm as guilty as those who exploit it. Personal desires are selfish when there's work to be done."

### Truth She Learns
"I can love someone and still hold them accountable. I can want something for myself without it being selfish. Change happens through persistent small acts, not perfect martyrdom."

### Healing Milestones
1. **First boundary enforcement** (refuses Cyran's bribe-offer)
2. **First risk to career** (Ch. 14—refuses to authorize his exploitation)
3. **First vulnerability admission** (confesses she wants him, not just duty)
4. **Public defiance** (Ch. 16—stands between Cyran and priest)
5. **Claiming desire** (Ch. 17—initiates intimacy as choice, not duty)
