### Voice Checklist (Use Before Writing Every Solen Line)

**Ask yourself**:
1. ✅ Is he explaining too much?
2. ✅ Does guilt color every decision?
3. ✅ Is he trying to save everyone alone?
4. ✅ Is he citing research or ancient texts?
5. ✅ If emotional, is he trying to intellectualize it first?
6. ✅ Is he resisting Cipher while clearly still attracted?

**Red flags** (avoid these):
- ❌ Simple answers without context
- ❌ Not feeling responsible for everything
- ❌ Accepting help easily
- ❌ Being emotionally direct without academic deflection

- To understand the complete system
- To undo the damage he caused

### Deep Wants
- To be forgiven (by himself, by the city, by Cipher)
- To understand the complete truth
- To stop being lonely
- To believe he's not fundamentally corrupted

### Fears
- Falling for Cipher's manipulation again
- That he's fundamentally corrupted by their original collaboration
- The city dying because of his hubris  
- Repeating his mistakes
- That he wants Cipher for wrong reasons

### Core Lie He Believes About Himself
**"If I can understand the system completely, I can fix what I broke."**

- Guilt about the Night of Shattered Vows

**Defensive Anger (Frustrated Academic)**:
- People questioning his conclusions
- Cipher being deliberately obtuse
- Inability to solve a problem
- Being forbidden from research areas

**Genuine Vulnerability Breaks Through When**:
- Admitting he still cares about Cipher
- Facing that knowledge won't solve this
- Asking for help (revolutionary for him)

- Doesn't pull away as quickly

**Late Book**:
- Initiates contact (revolutionary)

### Fight-or-Flight Tells

**When Overwhelmed by Guilt**:
